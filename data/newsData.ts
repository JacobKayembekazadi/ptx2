(TSXV: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF) (Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (“<strong>PTX</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”) is pleased to announce completion of a structurally-oriented, geological review and the new, high-resolution, airborne magnetics survey of the northern and central portion of its Shining Tree Gold Property, located in South Timmins along the Ridout-Tyrrell Deformation Zone (also known as “RTDZ”) in Ontario, Canada. Sampling from the surface work resulted in multiple high-grade assays reported below. The highlights from the sampling were collected by SRK at the Rhonda and Herrick Targets, where samples returned <strong>up to 69.00 g/t Au</strong> and <strong>18.82 g/t Au </strong>respectively.</p><p><em>Table 1.

Although the mineralized trends at each prospect are well-understood, how they relate to one another, and, more importantly, the regional geodynamic setting, requires further study. </p><p>Preliminary results from the structural review of the property suggests that available, regional geologic maps do not accurately depict the property’s structural setting. During SRK’s data collection and structural review of the property, 27 rock samples were taken for various purposes across the property (See Figure 1). The purposes of these samples were variable, with some of these samples being taken in attempt to reproduce historic, higher-grade Au values, while others were taken to develop understanding of the controls on localization of gold within the various veins and shear zones found across the property.  Samples from both the Rhonda and Herrick areas returned the most significant results, returning <strong>up to 69.00 g/t</strong> and <strong>18.82 g/t Au</strong>respectively.  </p><p>The most comprehensive sampling was conducted at the Rhonda North Trench (See Figure 2) where samples were taken both along previously cut channels (i.e. resamples) and to the North of 2024 trenching extents along the projected vein trace. Resampling of high-grade channels from 2024 has demonstrated excellent reproducibility, suggesting higher Au grades are not the result of a nugget effect, but most likely the result of localized, but traceable, variability along the Rhonda structure that can be effectively targeted.  Additionally, 4 grab samples of the Rhonda vein taken along strike and North of the 2024 Rhona North Trench demonstrate reliable continuation of gold values north of modern trenching and channel sampling. Results from these 4 samples ranged from 3.54 to 7.85 g/t Au. </p><p>All samples were hand-delivered to SGS Labs in Sudbury, Ontario who analyzed the samples for Au content via a 30/50g fire assay with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish.  SGS is an ISO 17025:2005 accredited testing laboratory. SGS performed an internal QA/QC program which includes the insertion of CRM’s, blanks, sample repeats, and duplicate samples as is compliant with industry standards.  </p><p>In addition to SRK’s structural review and the aforementioned sampling, PTX commissioned Terrascope Inc. to conduct a high-resolution, drone magnetics survey across the central portion of PTX’s Shining Tree claims.  The survey wrapped up on December 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025 with a total of 2783.5 line Km flown. The primary objective of the survey was to replace the current, low-resolution magnetics dataset used by the Company with a much higher-resolution dataset to aid with mapping the largely overburden-covered property.  The current magnetics dataset is insufficient to delineate and target potentially gold-bearing structures; however, we expect this new magnetics survey, in combination with the structural information obtained from the SRK structural interpretation, will provide a sound foundation for developing successful exploration campaigns in the future. </p><figure><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/12/21091053/Picture1.png" alt="Picture1" /></figure></figure><p><em>Figure 1:  Map of the Central Area of the property displaying locations of the Herrick, Rhonda and Caswell areas and associated grab samples.

Data considered during drill planning includes, but is not limited to, previous PTX and historic drilling cumulating more than a 120 drill holes, the recent 2025 high-resolution magnetic survey and the subsequent 3D inversion model, the electromagnetic survey and the resulting Maxwell Plates. Latest compilation of data and the newest drill holes from PTX show that the mineralization is mainly hosted within a deformed, sulfide-bearing, highly magnetic gabbroic unit, which has been affected by various structural regimes. These previous steps allow significant de-risking for targeting wide mineralized intersections and potential localized massive sulfides zones intercepts.</p><p>The current work is being conducted and based out of an exploration camp at the property located 60km south of Webequie First Nation (WFN), where various support services at WFN are being used for the W2 Project.</p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/12/01074904/picture-1-1024x579.jpg" alt="Picture 1" style="width:1180px;height:auto" /></figure><p><em>Picture 1:  Cyr Drilling rig currently drilling at the W2 Project</em></p><p>Greg Ferron, CEO &amp; President states: “We are particularly excited to be back drilling at the W2 Project this year with a more extensive program.

        content: `<p><strong>Toronto, Ontario – </strong>November  24, 2025 – Green Canada Corporation (“<strong>GCC</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”), a 54.3% owned subsidiary of PTX Metals Inc. (TSXV: PTX) (“<strong>PTX</strong>”) and a uranium exploration company with a portfolio of projects located in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, the Thelon Basin, Nunavut, and the Otish Basin in Quebec, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding letter of intent (the “<strong>RTO LOI</strong>”) dated November 13, 2025 with MAACKK Capital Corp. (“<strong>MAACKK</strong>”) pursuant to which GCC and MAACKK intend to complete a transaction that would result in a reverse take-over of MAACKK by the shareholders of GCC (the “<strong>Proposed RTO</strong>”). Closing of the Proposed RTO will be subject to, among other things, requisite regulatory approval for the listing of the resulting issuer of the Proposed RTO (the “<strong>Resulting Issuer</strong>”) on the Canadian Securities Exchange or such other stock exchange as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the “<strong>Exchange</strong>”).</p><p>In connection with the Proposed RTO, GCC has also entered into a binding letter of intent (the “<strong>Mineral Rights LOI</strong>”) dated as of November 13, 2025 with Basin Energy Limited (ASX: BSN) (“<strong>BSN</strong>”) and BSN’s wholly owned subsidiary Basin Energy Marshall Corp. (“<strong>BSN Sub</strong>”) in respect of GCC’s proposed acquisition of BSN Sub’s 100% interest in the mineral claims known as the “Marshall Project” located in Saskatchewan, Canada (the “<strong>Proposed Mineral Rights Acquisition</strong>”).</p><p>In connection with the Mineral Rights LOI, GCC, BSN, BSN Sub and CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. (TSXV: CVV) (“<strong>CVV</strong>”) entered into a binding term sheet agreement (the “<strong>Operator and Exclusivity Right Term Sheet Agreement</strong>”) in connection with (A) the appointment of CVV as the operator of the Marshall Project (the “<strong>Operator</strong>”) to carry out the Initial Work Program (as defined below) and (B) the granting by CVV and BSN to GCC of a 9-month exclusivity right to conduct due diligence and, if satisfactory, negotiate the terms of an earn-in option to acquire up to a 51% interest in the North Millennium Joint Venture Project of CVV and BSN (the “<strong>NMX Exclusive Right</strong>”).</p><p>Greg Ferron, Chief Executive Officer of PTX and a director of GCC, commented:<strong> </strong>“<em>This acquisition brings GCC a flagship asset in the Athabasca Basin leveraging the exploration work and expertise completed by two experienced teams; CanAlaska and Basin. In addition, I would like to welcome new members of the Board bringing significant uranium experience, including Rick Mazur as the Proposed Executive Chairman of the Resulting Issuer.</em>”</p><p><strong>Terms of the Proposed RTO</strong></p><p>Under the Proposed RTO, MAACKK will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of GCC by way of an amalgamation (the “<strong>Amalgamation</strong>”) between GCC and a wholly owned subsidiary of MAACKK to be incorporated in the same jurisdiction as GCC, and the amalgamated entity (“<strong>Amalco</strong>”) will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MAACKK. Pursuant to the Amalgamation, the shareholders of Amalco will receive common shares in the capital of MAACKK, resulting in a reverse-take-over of MAACKK. The structure of the Proposed RTO may be revised to accommodate tax considerations, accounting treatments and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. </p><p>It is proposed that a concurrent non-brokered private placement will be completed by GCC for aggregate gross proceeds of \$2,500,000 (the “<strong>Concurrent Financing</strong>”) on or prior to the closing of the Proposed RTO. The pricing and terms of the Concurrent Financing will be determined by GCC and its advisors in the context of prevailing market conditions and will be completed in tranches. GCC and MAACKK have agreed that prior to the closing of the Proposed RTO and after giving effect to the Debt Settlement (as defined below), MAACKK will consolidate all of its issued and outstanding common shares on a 6.25 to 1 basis (the “<strong>Consolidation</strong>”). Pursuant to the terms of the RTO LOI, at the time of closing of the Proposed RTO, after giving effect to the Amalgamation, each common share of Amalco will be exchanged for one common share of the Resulting Issuer (the “<strong>Resulting Issuer Shares</strong>”).</p><p>Completion of the Proposed RTO will require, among other things, approval of the shareholders of GCC at a special meeting to be convened in due course to consider and approve all matters necessary to implement and complete the Proposed RTO.  While the Proposed RTO does not require the approval of the shareholders of MAACKK, pursuant to the terms of the RTO LOI, GCC may request MAACKK to hold a shareholders’ meeting and seek shareholders’ approval to: (a) the Consolidation, (b) change its name to such name as may be requested by GCC and subject to applicable legal requirements, (c) elect the new directors of the Resulting Issuer, (d) rectify the past corporate actions of MAACKK, and (e) approve such other matters as may be reasonably requested by GCC (collectively, the “<strong>Meeting Matters</strong>”). The name change, if applicable, will take effect upon or after the closing of the Proposed RTO. </p><p>PTX holds approximately 54.3% of GCC’s issued and outstanding common shares on a non-diluted basis. Upon completion of the Proposed RTO, PTX and other GCC shareholders will receive the Resulting Issuer Shares in exchange for the shares they currently hold in GCC. PTX currently holds 18,166,666 common shares of GCC. The total number of Resulting Issuer Shares will be determined based on the pricing of the Concurrent Financing, and will include PTX’s shareholdings following completion of the Amalgamation. No finder&#8217;s fees are expected to be paid in connection with the Proposed RTO. The Proposed RTO is an Arm&#8217;s Length Transaction under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (the “<strong>TSXV</strong>”). </p><p>Closing of the Proposed RTO is subject to completion and execution of all definitive transaction documents (including accuracy of representations and warranties, compliance with covenants and satisfaction of customary conditions),  completion of the Concurrent Financing, completion of a debt settlement by MAACKK to eliminate all outstanding indebtedness prior to closing (the “<strong>Debt Settlement</strong>”), execution of the mineral claims purchase agreement and other associated agreements in connection with the Proposed Mineral Rights Acquisition (the “<strong>Mineral Claims Purchase Agreement</strong>”) and the granting of NMX Exclusive Right by CVV and BSN to GCC, and the satisfaction (or waiver) of all closing conditions therein (which conditions do not include the closing of the Proposed RTO), and receipt of all requisite approvals and consents for the Proposed RTO including, but not limited to, (i) approval by the board of directors of each of PTX, GCC and MAACKK, (ii) approval of the Proposed RTO by the shareholders of GCC, (iii) approval of the Meeting Matters by the shareholders of MAACKK, if required by GCC, and (iv) conditional approval of the Proposed RTO and listing of Resulting Issuer Shares on the Exchange. </p><p>Upon completion of the Proposed RTO, the current directors and officers of MAACKK will resign and it is anticipated that the board of directors of the Resulting Issuer will be reconstituted to consist of the following directors: Richard J. Mazur, Greg Ferron, Jean-David Moore, Olivier Crottaz and a representative of BSN with Rhys Davies as Geological Advisor. </p><p>The following sets out the names and backgrounds of all persons who are expected to be the directors and officers of the Resulting Issuer upon closing of the Proposed RTO:</p><p><strong>Richard (Rick) Mazur, Director &amp; Executive Chairman</strong></p><p>Mr. Richard Mazur is a corporate executive and registered geoscientist (P.Geo.) with over 45 years of Canadian and international experience in the exploration and mining industry as a project geologist, financial analyst and senior executive on uranium, gold, diamonds, base metals, and industrial minerals projects.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Operator and Exclusivity Right Term Sheet Agreement, upon closing of the Proposed RTO, CVV and BSN will grant a 9-month exclusivity right to GCC to conduct due diligence and, if satisfactory, negotiate the terms of an earn-in option to acquire up to a 51% interest in the North Millennium Joint Venture Project of CVV and BSN (Figure 1).</p><p>The Marshall Project and the adjacent North Millennium project areas are situated 11 km west of Cameco’s 69.9% owned Millennium deposit and 20 km southwest of CanAlaska’s Pike zone discovery on the West McArthur project in the Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan. The Key Lake-McArthur Road is 23 km to the South-East with winter access to the property either by winter road from the Millennium deposit to Friesen Lake, 4 km east of the property, or by a winter road from Key Lake to McIntyre Lake, 4 km south of the property. </p><p>Both projects lie at or near the boundary between the Mudjatik and the Wollaston domains. These are underlain by sandstone and siltstones of the Clampitt-Dunlop Formation of the Manitou Falls Group. The depth to basement is estimated from 700 to 900 metres, with only three outcrops mapped locally.  </p><p>From 1978 to 2009, mineral exploration focussed on lake sediment geochemistry, sandstone boulder geochemistry, airborne magnetic and electromagnetic surveys (e.g. INPUT, ZTEM, and VTEM), as well as ground geophysical magnetic and electromagnetic surveys. To date, no drill investigations have been undertaken within either project area. In 2024, BSN completed Stepwise Moving Loop Transient Electromagnetic (SWML-TEM) surveys by Discovery International Geophysics Inc. on the Marshall and North Millennium projects. The SWML-TEM survey for Marshall covered 49.1 line-km of TEM coverage along 1 survey line with 17 loops. The SWML-TEM survey for North Millennium covered 33.8 line-km of TEM along 3 survey lines, with 12 loops. Recommendations for the Marshall project are to carry out a first-pass diamond drill program for unconformity-related uranium mineralization testing the conductivity targets defined during the SWML-TEM survey.<a href="applewebdata://7E48510E-36A1-4B28-AC6C-1D252F1FF6A5#_ftn1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p><p>The Marshall Project centres on a magnetic low consistent with the presence of a metasedimentary basin. A Northeast – Southwest trending magnetic conductor separates this low into two sub-basins. Elevated ZTEM conductivity over the southern sub-basin and associated VTEM anomaly implies of a prospective blind sandstone conductor and prospective drill target. </p><p>The North Millennium project is underlain by 700 – 900 m of Athabasca Basin sandstone. Basement assemblages beneath the sandstone cover consist of Wollaston-Mudjatik Domain transition rocks. In the adjacent McTavish property where geophysical conductors have been drill-tested, prominent alteration zones have been identified with intersections of up to 0.13% U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>recorded<a href="applewebdata://7E48510E-36A1-4B28-AC6C-1D252F1FF6A5#_ftn2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, together with anomalous Ni, Co, Cu, and Zn assays. <em>It should be noted that </em><em>information disclosed from adjacent properties is not necessarily indicative to the mineralization on the property.</em></p><p>Northeast trending conductors within the North Millennium project are offset by a prominent north-south trending lineament which can be linked to the Millennium deposit. This structural feature is interpreted as a continuation of the Mother Fault, which forms the main conduit for ore-bearing fluids, which led to the formation of the Millennium deposit. </p><p>In consideration for the Proposed Mineral Rights Acquisition, GCC will pay BSN a total purchase price consisting of (A) C\$600,000 payable in cash in four equal annual installments; (B) C\$300,000 payable in Resulting Issuer Shares, issuable in three equal annual installments based on the 5-day Volume-Weighted Average Price of the Resulting Issuer Shares on the business day immediately preceding the date of issuance of such Resulting Issuer Shares; and (C) such number of Resulting Issuer Shares as is equal to 9.99% of the total issued and outstanding Resulting Issuer Shares on a non-diluted basis after giving effect to the Concurrent Financing at the time of closing of the Proposed RTO.</p><p>BSN will retain a right of first refusal on any sale of the Marshall Project by GCC for a period of three (3) years following the closing date of the Proposed Mineral Rights Acquisition. In addition, BSN will retain a repurchase right to acquire from GCC a 25% interest in the Marshall Project for C\$1,000,000 for a period commencing on the closing date and ending on the earlier of: (A) the date that is five (5) years from the closing date or (b) the date on which GCC has incurred total exploration expenditures of C\$10,000,000 on the Marshall Project.</p><p>Pursuant to the terms of the Mineral Rights LOI, GCC is required to fund exploration expenditures for an initial work program (the “<strong>Initial Work Program</strong>”) on the Marshall Project to be carried out within twenty-four (24) months from the closing date (the “<strong>Initial Exploration Period</strong>”). The Initial Work Program will have a budget in an amount that is the greater of (a) C\$1,500,000, and (b) the minimum amount required to maintain the mineral claims comprising the Marshall Project in good standing under applicable governmental regulations (the “<strong>Initial Exploration Expenditures</strong>”).  </p><p><strong>Operator and Exclusivity Right Term Sheet Agreement</strong></p><p>Pursuant to the terms of the Operator and Exclusivity Right Term Sheet Agreement, the parties agreed that CVV will act as the Operator of the Marshall Project to carry out the Initial Work Program. GCC will pay CVV an operator fee equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Initial Exploration Expenditures for its services performed in connection with the Initial Work Program. </p><p>As consideration for the NMX Exclusive Right, GCC will issue 600,000 Resulting Issuer Shares to CVV and 400,000 Resulting Issuer Shares to BSN upon closing of the Proposed RTO.</p><p><strong>About GCC</strong></p><p>Green Canada Corporation is a Canadian uranium and critical minerals exploration and development company with a portfolio of mineral properties focused on unconformity-style uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, the Baker and Amer Basins in Nunavut and the Otish Basin in Quebec.</p><p>The Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects for this news release is Rhys Davies, MSc., RP.

        content: `<p><strong>TORONTO, November 7th, 2025 (NEWSFILE) – PTX Metals Inc. (TSXV: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF) ( Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (“<strong>PTX</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”) is pleased to report positive results of the 3D inversion processed from the 2025 magnetic survey (“Mag Survey”) at its W2 Copper-Nickel and Platinum-Palladium-Gold (PGEs) Project in Ontario, Canada. This new data brings significant insight into the behavior at surface and depth of the targeted gabbroic horizons linked with the mineralization. This leads to increasing confidence for drill targeting and provides more visibility for expansion of the target. The Company is also advancing other activities including a drill program at W2 Project. </p><p>Additionally, PTX Metals is pleased to see recent developments announced by Ontario government on October 29, 2025, related to a signed agreement with Webequie First Nations that includes:</p><ul><li>Funding local community priorities</li><li>Providing necessary infrastructure upgrades </li><li>Speeding up construction of the roads and infrastructure in the region (see <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1006668/ontario-and-webequie-first-nation-sign-historic-agreement-to-unlock-the-ring-of-fire" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Ontario and Webequie First Nation Sign Historic Agreement to Unlock the Ring of Fire</strong></a>) </li></ul><p><strong><u>Results from the 3D Inversion</u></strong></p><figure><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/11/07105821/Figure-1-final.png" alt="Figure 1" /></figure></figure><p><em>Figure 1:  Location of the 3D section highlighted below in Figure 2. Background is the TMI result from the mag survey.</em></p><figure><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/11/07105822/Figure-2-final.png" alt="Figure 2" /></figure></figure><p><em>Figure 2:  3D section of the CA1 zone showing the 3D inversion results (bottom figure), and two zoom-in sections showing % CuEq intercepts and logged lithology as indicated (top figure). </em></p><p>Results are strongly suggestive of a magmatic causative source highlighted as a stronger response in the magnetic pattern (yellow and red in Figure 2), which correlates well with the position of the mapped magnetic gabbro. Earlier this year, the Company released an initial geological interpretation identifying a preferred folded horizon extending for an estimated 8-km in strike length. Additional structures such as thrusting and faulting led to imbrications for stacked mineralized intercepts especially in the CA zones. Similarly, the AP zones seem to have been strongly structurally affected as well.</p><p>The 3D inversion result confirms this distinct pattern, showing multiple north-south imbrications allowing formation of near-surface bulk tonnage targets. For example, as indicated in the section A – 460500E (Figure 2), the stacked zone could reach up to 1,850m width and extending to depth. Along trend, similarities can be observed between CA1 and CA2 with some variations such as thickness, dip and orientation depending on the main structural strains.</p><p>An independent geophysicist processed the Mag Survey data which consists in flight lines trending north-south spaced at 75 meters and a mean terrain clearance of 34 meters. Additionally, for compilation, other data was considered for this evaluation such as the Electromagnetic (EM). The EM data was used in 2024 to further process and to generate Maxwell plates in order to delineate conductors. It is important to note that unconstrained potential field models as calculated by a magnetic inversion process do not have unique solutions, and that at deeper depths the resolution of the models and confidence in the results are reduced. </p><p>Overall interpretations and observations, tend to vector ideas toward a mineralized horizon within the gabbro and a tendency for higher-grade zones at contact with the metavolcanics unit. The mineralization also indicates multi-stage deposition, which is currently being investigated under a paragenesis study and is expected to increase confidence in the model and assist in future targeting.</p><p><strong><u>PTX Exploration Program at W2 </u></strong></p><p>The Company continues to advance an extensive work program, which includes a drill program, ongoing metallurgical testing, paragenesis study and age dating study on the gabbroic horizons of interest using the 2024 and 2025 core drilled by the Company.</p><p>In October 2025, a LIDAR survey was flown by KBM Resources Group. Results are expected by early January 2026 and comprise a detailed topography and orthophoto, which will help for future resource modeling as well as locating historical work on the property.</p><p>The Company will provide shortly a separate press release outlining the drill program and its objectives. </p><p><strong><u>Ontario and Webequie First Nation Sign Historic Agreement to Unlock the Ring of Fire</u></strong></p><p>Ontario recently signed an agreement with Webequie FN to fund local community priorities and necessary infrastructure improvements ahead of construction of roads and other upgrades in the Ring of Fire. The province says that this support is a critical step in the development and construction of the proposed all-season Webequie Supply Road to the Ring of Fire. Funding will also support studies to realign other winter roads and ultimately will link all season roads to existing Pickle Lake corridor, which extends near the western edge of the W2 Project. </p><figure><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/11/07105821/Figure-3-1024x718.png" alt="Figure 3" /></figure></figure><p><em>Figure 3:  Location map of the Webequie Supply Road and the proposed road access to the Ring of Fire. </em></p><p>For more information here: <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1006668/ontario-and-webequie-first-nation-sign-historic-agreement-to-unlock-the-ring-of-fire" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1006668/ontario-and-webequie-first-nation-sign-historic-agreement-to-unlock-the-ring-of-fire</a></p><p><strong><u>Qualified Person</u></strong></p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Kyle Pedersen, a non-independent qualified person to PTX Metals who is responsible for ensuring that the related technical information provided in this news release is accurate and who act as a “qualified person” (QP) as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p><strong><u>About PTX Metals Inc</u></strong></p><p>PTX is a mineral exploration company focused on high-quality strategic metals assets in northern Ontario, allowing exposure for shareholders to Copper, Gold, Nickel, and PGEs discoveries.

        content: `<p><strong>August 11th, 2025</strong></p><p><strong>TORONTO, August 11th, 2025 (NEWSFILE) – PTX Metals Inc. (TSXV: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (“<strong>PTX</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”) is pleased to provide an update on the recent results from a preliminary mineralogy and mineral liberation study (MLA) and subsequent work program for the Company’s 100% owned, W2 Nickel-Copper-PGE (Platinum Group Elements) and Gold Project, located near the Ring of Fire, northwestern Ontario, Canada (the “<strong>W2 Project</strong>”).</p><p>After the successful drilling program throughout 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter of  2025, where the Company intercepted significant wide mineralized intervals up to 235m (press release May 27<sup>th</sup>, 2025), and expanded presence of PGEs mineralization, PTX is executing the following phased exploration program with a focus on understanding metallogeny and sizing the mineralizing system, including studies on geophysics and metallurgy, as well as age dating, paragenesis. Results of such planned approach are expected to enhance economic viability and prepare the project for a directed-upcoming drill program.<br></p><p><strong><u>Highlights:</u></strong></p><ul><li>Positive results from the mineral liberation analysis and mineralogy study indicate that copper and nickel are linked to chalcopyrite and pentlandite, respectively.</li><li>Initiated the Q3 2025 work program at the W2 Project:<ul><li>Launch of a preliminary metallurgical test conducted by SGS Canada Inc., using core material from the 2024 and 2025 PTX drilling programs.</li></ul><ul><li>Launch of a 3D inversion geophysics study using the most recent 2025 Heli-GT magnetic survey (“Mag Survey”), with primary initial focus on the Central Target.</li></ul><ul><li>Launch of a U–Pb CA‑ID‑TIMS age-dating study, focusing on the gabbro, which is identified as primary host for mineralization at the W2 deposit.</li></ul><ul><li>Launch of a mineralization paragenesis study to constrain the relative timing of ore-bearing minerals.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong><u>Preliminary Mineralogy and Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA):</u></strong></p><p>Over the past several months, PTX has completed an initial overview of mineralogy and an MLA study of disseminated, semi-massive to massive sulfide mineralized intercepts from hole W224-03, W224-04, W224-05, and W224-06 of PTX’s 2024 drill program at the Central Target. This study was carried out by the Carleton University Mineral Resource Department in Ottawa, Ontario. This preliminary study was directed at refining the Company’s knowledge of copper and nickel mineralization within the mineralized envelope of the W2 deposit.</p><p>The study confirmed that copper exists almost entirely in chalcopyrite, which is floatable and easily recoverable. The study also confirmed that nickel exists in pentlandite in high grade zones, while pyrrhotite is the dominant host for nickel in the lower grade zone of the W2 deposit. In the case of cobalt, it has been observed that it consistently substitutes for nickel in pentlandite in all samples here studied. Overall, all samples have shown in all size fractions a high degree of liberation, such as Pyrrhotite showed the highest values with an average of 96.8%, followed by pyrite at 94.2%, chalcopyrite at 94.25% and finally pentlandite at 92%. For the most part, liberation increased as sieve size decreased. The samples used are not fully representative of the overall deposit, as the size and the distribution were limited. The Company will now proceed with additional, more advanced mineralogical and metallurgical studies, which will be carried out using material obtained from the most recent PTX drill programs out of the CA zones.</p><p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

line-height:115%"></p><strong>1. Metallurgical testing:</strong> PTX is pleased to announce the engagement of SGS Canada Inc in Lakefield, ON to carry out initial metallurgical test work using composites from the CA and AP Zones, located within the Central Target on the W2 property. The results of the metallurgical testing will provide critical information on the recoverability of Cu-Ni-Palladium, Platinum, Gold and Cobalt mineralization, and potential for future economic studies. The purpose of the test program is to evaluate the flotation response of the ore and to determine successful conditions for producing concentrates enriched in copper, nickel, PGEs, and gold. Additionally, the impact of gravity and magnetic separation on the recovery of PGEs, nickel, gold and cobalt will also be assessed. (See below for additional information of SGS Canada).</p><p><strong>2. 3D-inversion geophysics study: </strong>The Company has entered into an agreement with an independent geophysicist to evaluate the Heli-GT magnetics (“Mag Survey”)and to complete a 3D-inversion model over the Central target area. The purpose of the model would be to provide a reliable representation of a magnetic gabbroic lithology that was shown by earlier work to have a direct spatial correlation with mineralization. Drilling completed in April 2025 has not only confirmed extension of mineralization through infill drilling, but has also outlined repetitive mineralized horizons, which have shown to be open at depth. Moving forward the 3D-inversion will allow the Company to put into perspective the potential extension of the host lithological unit at depth. To date, this geophysics study will be the first extensive processing that PTX initiates, which will expand into further findings and is expected to set the base for a more extensive drill program targeting from the disseminated sulfide envelop to the massive sulfide zones.</p><p>The initial mag interpretation was performed using 2D data jointly compiled with the geological data from historical drilling and conductivity anomalies. Results led to outlining a direct correlation of mineralization with a gabbro lithology unit, for which the geophysics methods stated above have emphasized the continuous nature of the targeted domains. Initially modeled as discrete zones (CA1, CA2 and AP) in the Exploration Target released on September 4<sup>th</sup>, 2024 (the Exploration Target), this latest interpretation highlighted the potential continuity of the mineralization along trend as one or more Cu-Ni-Au-PG-bearing gabbro horizons that can be traced for approximately 8 km (Figure 1).</p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/08/11100206/Figure-1_PTX-PR11-1024x754.png" alt="Figure 1 Ptx Pr11" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: Zoom-in Central Target, showing the latest mag survey from January 2025, that will be used for 3D-inversion.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>3. Age dating</strong>: PTX has engaged Dr. Steven Denyszyn of Memorial University of Newfoundland, a recognized specialist in U–Pb CA‑ID‑TIMS geochronology, to conduct age‑dating of the W2 Ni‑Cu‑PGE intrusion. These studies will provide important context for the Company to 1) confirm and build a direct link with other deposits of the Ring of Fire 2) refine metallogenic models and metal fertility 3) understand the genetic relationships to other intrusions in the Ring of Fire and nearby known deposits.</p><p>The Company looks forward to sharing additional updates as lab work progresses, including results from the metallurgical recovery tests and geochronological studies currently underway.

        content: `<p><strong>TORONTO, June 17, 2025 (NEWSFILE) – PTX Metals Inc. (TSXV: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (“<strong>PTX</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”), a mineral exploration company focused on Cu-Ni-Au-PGE and Gold projects in Ontario, is pleased to release additional assay results fromdrill hole W225-09 from its Phase 1 drilling program of 2025 at the W2 Copper Nickel PGEs (Platinum Group Elements) and Gold Project located near the Ring of Fire, northwestern Ontario, Canada (the “<strong>W2 Project</strong>”). Those additional results follow up the previous releases of May 27<sup>th</sup> and June 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2025.</p><p>The reported drill hole W225-09 intersected sulphide mineralization hosting copper, nickel, gold, palladium and platinum over a core length of <strong>49.16m</strong>, including higher-grade intervals of <strong>30.00m of 0.59% Cu+Ni and 0.26 g/t Au+Pt+Pd </strong>from 46.00 to 76.00m, and <strong>7.50m grading 1.05% Cu+Ni and 0.29 g/t Au+Pt+Pd </strong>from 50.00m to 57.50m (see Table 1).</p><p>This hole, located in the CA1 zone of the Central Target, was drilled 246m east of drill hole W225-08 and 284m southwest of W225-10. Both of those previously released holes intersected wide sulfide mineralized zones, for which hole W225-10 reported the widest interval to date with up to 235.14m of mineralized core length directly below the overburden (Figure 1 &amp; 2). With this wide-spacing design, the Company effectively and successfully verified nearby historical drilling data, which supports and validates a significant portion of the Exploration Target from 2024 leaving opportunity for expansion along strike and at depth.</p><p>Additionally, as PTX has sampled and assayed for PGEs and gold more consistently throughout the entire holes, it was observed that in addition to the wide-spread copper-nickel mineralization, there was a significant improvement of PGE mineralization in both CA1 and CA2 zones. This discovery made in this year’s drilling program is value-added to the Exploration Target, for which PGEs were previously estimated ranging from 59 million to 135 million tonnes of PGEs (Pd+Pt+Au) with an average grade estimate of Palladium between 0.40 g/t to 0.28 g/t, Platinum between 0.13 g/t to 0.11 g/t and gold between 0.10 g/t to 0.07 g/t Au (using 0.7%-0.5% CuEq cut-off) <strong>[1]</strong>. The Company will follow up with plans to keep growing confidence in the overall mineralized block and expand it at depth and along strike as all data suggests that mineralization remains open.</p><p><strong><u>Highlights – Drill hole W225-09:</u></strong></p><ul><li>Drill hole W225-09, a shallow hole drilled to a depth of 119.00 m, intersected sulphide mineralization <strong>including 30.00m of 0.59% Cu+Ni and 0.26 g/t Au+Pt+Pd </strong>from 46.00 to 76.00m and <strong>7.50m of 1.05% Cu+Ni and 0.29 g/t Au+Pt+Pd </strong>from 50.00m to 57.50m within an overall core length of <strong>49.16 m grading 0.45% Cu+Ni, and 0.21 g/t Au+Pt+Pd </strong>which included numerous higher-grade intervals that returned above 1% Cu+Ni.<ul><li><strong>1.50 m of 2.15% Cu+Ni and 0.49 g/t Au+Pt+Pd</strong> from 50.00 to 51.50 m<strong>0.58 m of 3.50% Cu+Ni and 0.65 g/t Au+Pt+Pd</strong> from 55.50 to 56.08 m.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>1.05 m of 1.07% Cu+Ni and 1.01 g/t Au+Pt+Pd </strong>from 63.00 to 64.05m</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>High-grade individual commodity intersections within drill Hole W225-09 include:<ul><li><strong>3.31% Copper over 0.58 m </strong>from 55.50 m to 56.08 m</li></ul><ul><li><strong>0.54% Nickel over 0.76 m </strong>from 50.00 m to 50.76 m</li></ul><ul><li><strong>0.29 g/t Gold over 0.95 m </strong>from 64.05 m to 65.00 m</li></ul><ul><li><strong>0.39 g/t Platinum over 0.55 m </strong>from 63.50 m to 64.05 m</li></ul><ul><li><strong>1.10 g/t Palladium over 0.50 m </strong>from 63.00 m to 63.50 m</li></ul><ul><li><strong>0.09 % Cobalt over 0.76 m </strong>from 50.00 m to50.76 m</li></ul></li></ul><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/06/17090254/TABLE-1-PR10.png" alt="Table 1 Pr10" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Table 1: Selected composite results from drill hole W225-09.

        content: `<p><strong>TORONTO, May 27, 2025 (NEWSFILE) – PTX Metals Inc. (TSXV: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (“<strong>PTX</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”), a mineral exploration company focused on Cu-Ni-Au-PGE and Gold projects in Ontario, announces initial assay results from two drill holes of its Phase 1 of  2025 drilling program at the W2 Cu-Ni-PGE and Gold Project  located in the Ring of Fire, northwestern Ontario, Canada (the “<strong>W2 Project</strong>”). This marks the first drill campaign in the CA zones (CA1 and CA2 see attached image) since 1990s, aiming to infill, confirm and expand historical reported drill results. Assays are pending for the additional drillholes.</p><p>The W2 Project drilling strategy targets near-surface copper-bearing disseminated sulphide mineralization and aims to demonstrate the continuity of the system along strike and at depth. Based on the current and historical drilling, combined with geophysical surveys, the central target area is interpreted to extend for approximately 8 km in strike length and remains open at depth (see press release of May 7<sup>th</sup>, 2025).</p><p>The second objective of the exploration program was to better delineate semi-massive to massive sulfides mineralization as well as Nickel sulphides in the CA zones reported by historical mineral exploration work, and to evaluate the presence of Gold and Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) that were not assayed in many historical drill holes.</p><p>Historical drilling was selective in assaying for all commodities and selective sampling procedures occurred. As a result, the Company has systematically assayed for Copper, Nickel, Gold, Palladium, Platinum and Cobalt and is now not reporting using Metal Equivalents and seen substantial improvements in the widths of mineralization with these practices. Additionally, for simplification purposes, Cu+Ni (%) and Au+Pt+Pd (g/t) are reported below as the arithmetic sum of individual commodity per interval chosen. Individual grades by commodity are also shown in table 1.</p><p><strong>Highlights – Drill Holes W225-10 and W225-11</strong></p><ul><li>Drillhole W225-10 intercepted the widest mineralized near-surface intercept to date, which reports a width of 235.14 m of mineralization, starting directly after the overburden at 19.86m. Located 3 km away to the east, drillhole W225-11 intersected a zone of higher-grade near surface mineralization demonstrating consistence along strike of the targeted geophysical anomaly connecting CA1 and CA2 zones (see Figure 1).</li><li>Highest-grades by individual commodity in the two holes combined include: <strong>1.81% Copper, 1.48% Nickel, 5.59 g/t Gold, 0.66 g/t Platinum and 0.57 g/t Palladium and Cobalt 0.13%</strong></li><li>Drillhole W225-11 intercepted the CA2 Zone 58.00 of core length from <strong>37.00 m to 95.00 m and returned 0.27% Cu, 0.21% Ni, and 0.23 g/t Au+Pt+Pd</strong>, including multiple shorter higher-grade intervals such as:<ul><li><strong>17.00 m of 0.50% Cu, 0.40% Ni and 0.33 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd) and 2.07 m of 1.32% Cu, 0.26% Ni, and 0.20 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd) </strong>(see Table 1 below for details).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Drillhole W225-10 intercepted a near-surface significant number of continuous higher-grade intervals throughout the length of the 235.14 m that reported 0.17% Cu, 0.08% Ni and 0.18 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd) to 255.00 m, including multiple higher-grade intervals:<ul><li><strong>26.14 m of 0.30% Cu, 0.07% Ni, and 0.14 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd)</strong></li><li><strong>5.36 m of 0.59% Cu, 0.14% Ni and 0.29 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd)</strong></li><li><strong>29.00 m of 0.25% Cu, 0.15% Ni and 0.14 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd)</strong></li><li><strong>42.00 m at 0.22% Cu, 0.12% Ni and 0.1</strong><strong>5</strong><strong> g/t (Au+Pt+Pd)</strong></li><li><strong>13.00 m of 0.30% Cu, 0.14% Ni, and 0.36 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd)</strong></li><li><strong>6.60 m of 0.43% Cu, 0.20</strong><strong>%</strong><strong> Ni and 0.42 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd)</strong></li><li><strong>0.68 m of 1.5</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>% Cu</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> 0.29</strong><strong>%</strong><strong> Ni and 0.4</strong><strong>3</strong><strong> g/t (Au+Pt+Pd)</strong></li></ul></li><li>Systematic sampling in both holes shows improved widths over nearby historical drillholes suggesting potential to improve width and tonnage of the mineralized zones at depth (Figure 2 and 3). Additionally, a repeating pattern of higher-grade Cu-Ni mineralization within the broader hole has been observed throughout the holes, suggesting that further mineralization could extend at depth. Hole W225-10 intercepted 0.79% (Cu+Ni) and 54 g/t (Au+Pt+Pd) at 247.00-249.00m.</li></ul><p>Greg Ferron, President and CEO of PTX Metals, stated: “We are very encouraged by the results from drill holes W225-10 and W225-11 that were drilled into CA1 and CA2 zones respectively at our W2 Cu-Ni-PGE and Gold Project. These results start validating the exploration target issued last September, which outlines a large near-surface project and improves the understanding of our exploration model. Hole W225-10 and W225-11 intersected broader and deeper zones of mineralization than previously reported, demonstrating improved continuity and the potential to significantly expand both CA1 and CA2 zone at depth.”</p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/05/27140348/table-1.png" alt="Table 1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Table 1: Selected Results from drill holes W225-10 and W225-11. Intervals reported as core lengths. True widths are unknown at this time.</figcaption></figure><p>Drillhole W225-10, drilled into the CA1 Zone, was designed as an infill and expansion hole near historical holes 54004-0 and 54007-0 drilled by Inco. The new results not only confirmed the continuity of the mineralized horizon but defined a wider and deeper intercept than previously reported in historical data (Figure 2). Historical holes 54007-0 and 54005-0 were drilled at shallower depth and weren’t sampled throughout (up to 37.85m in hole 54007-0 and 42.43m in hole 54005-0 not sampled). PTX’s more comprehensive sampling in W225-10 demonstrates better continuity of the near-surface mineralization over a thicker interval; this could potentially lead to a growth upside toward the exploration target and toward a potential resource estimate. Follow-up drilling is being planned to further test continuity and grade of the CA1 zone.</p><p>Drillhole W225-11 was designed to infill and to validate historical drill holes, which duplicated holes 54002-0 drilled by Inco (noting with small adjustment in the azimuth and dip, allowing better definition of the true width). Also, historical Inco holes at CA2 zone were selectively sampled as well (Figure 3), which left largely the possibility for more positive results. Geochemically, copper, nickel, cobalt and PGEs seem to be correlated well over wide intercepts, while gold seems more erratic, even though Gold is present at lower grade in most of the drill holes. Further drilling in this area will be followed to confirm and to try to build a larger mineralized system.</p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/05/27135639/figure-1-1.png" alt="Figure 1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: Plan Map showing CA1 and CA2 Zones along with drill hole locations for W225-10 and W225-11.<span style="font-size: 16px;"> </span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/05/27135204/figure-2.png" alt="Figure 2" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 2: Cross section of drill hole W225-10, confirming and expanding the potential of the CA1 Zone.

        content: `<p><strong>TORONTO, May 7, 2025 (NEWSFILE) – PTX Metals Inc. (TSXV: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (“<strong>PTX</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”), a mineral exploration company focused on  Cu-Ni-Au-PGE and Gold projects in Ontario, is pleased to release a refined 3D geological interpretation and the new Heli-GT Magnetic Survey (Mag Survey) results for the Central Target area of the W2 Cu-Ni-Au-PGE Project (W2 Project) located in the Ring of Fire, Ontario, Canada. PTX engaged an independent consulting firm to create a 3D geological model and in-house resource estimate using the recently flown high-resolution Mag Survey, along with an incremented compilation of drilling data at the W2 Property.</p><p>This enhanced model has outlined a direct correlation of mineralization with a gabbro lithology unit, for which geophysics methods have emphasized the continuous nature of the targeted domains. Initially modeled as discrete zones (CA1, CA2 and AP) in the Exploration Target released on September 4<sup>th</sup>, 2024 (the Exploration Target), the new interpretation highlights the potential continuity of the mineralization as one or more Cu-Ni-Au-PG-bearing gabbro horizons that can be traced for approximately 8 km. These latest results produced a foundation for future exploration at the Central Target with objectives of improving and expanding the current resource estimates.</p><p>Additionally, as a corporate update, PTX is pleased to report that Cindy Davis, the company’s existing Corporate Controller, has been appointed to Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for a streamlined accounting and controller function.</p><p><strong>Highlights of outcomes from recent work at the Central Target</strong></p><ul><li>New 3D geological interpretation:<ul><li>Definition of an 8-km strike length folded stratigraphy-parallel horizon, and main host for mineralization.</li></ul><ul><li>Identified thrusting/fault imbrications responsible for thick mineralization intercepted at the CA1 showing; this geologic configuration is ideal for potential near surface bulk extraction.</li></ul><ul><li>Additional data compilation included 20 additional historical drill holes in the database, completing the consolidation of all historical and current drill holes for a total of 20,402m in 111 drill holes.</li></ul><ul><li>Updated 3D model formed the basis for an in-house, non-NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate which has further confirmed the Exploration Target, and will assist in providing context of ongoing exploration efforts.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>High-resolution Mag Survey:<ul><li>Improved definition of known magnetic anomalies.</li></ul><ul><li>Untested gabbro mag/conductivity high targets with potential for major expansion of the exploration target in the Central Target area.</li></ul></li></ul><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/05/07040917/Picture1.png" alt="Picture1" /></figure><p>Figure 1: Map view of interpretation for the Central Target Area of the W2 Property. Simplified geology and approximate location of fold axis (dashed blue), folded horizons A &amp; B (dashed white &amp; blue. Background is the reduced-to-pole total magnetic intensity (RTPTMI) derivative from the Mag Survey.</p><p><strong>The Central Target</strong></p><p>The Central Target is an area of approximately 8 x 4 km of the W2 Project, corresponding to about 10% of the size of the Project. Within this area, bulk tonnage Cu-Ni-Au-PGE mineralization is identified as disseminated sulfides with zones of semi to massive sulfides, hosted primarily within gabbroic to ultramafic intrusions. Mineralization is typically associated with geophysical anomalies as coincident magnetic and conductivity highs.  The CA and AP zones of the Central Target have been the focus of exploration for the Project, for which the data led to a rapid increase of knowledge on the mineralization style and growth potential.</p><p><strong>The new model interpretation</strong></p><p>The new model has emphasized the continuous nature of the magnetic and conductivity anomalies, interpreting the separate CA1, CA2 and AP zones as part of a single laterally extensive Cu-Ni-Au-PGE bearing gabbro horizon which can be traced across the Central Target area for approximately 8 km. The irregular geometry of the gabbro reflects a complex history of faulting and polyphase folding.</p><p>In the CA Zones, the map pattern has been interpreted as shallow-plunging tight to isoclinal folding around a near-vertical west-northwest striking axis extending for approximately 3 km from CA1 to CA2 zones. The updated geological model suggests a component of thrusting on many of the faults; this may locally have caused  imbrication and resultant thickening of mineralization as thrusting can cause panels of mineralized gabbro to be shifted and “stacked” on top of each other, leading to drilled intercepts of continuous mineralized gabbro over 220m in the historic holes LH01-06, see NI 43-101 technical report filed on Sedar in September 2024. Fault thickening may be a critical upgrading factor for mineralization at W2, producing broad localized domains of mineralization amenable to bulk extraction. </p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/05/07040932/Picture2-1024x527.png" alt="Picture2" /></figure><p>Figure 2: Cross section of the CA1 Target showing interpreted anticline and thrusting along the northern limb. Interpretation based on airborne geophysics and drill hole logging and assays. Base map includes RTPTMI derived from the 2025 HeliGT Mag Survey.</p><p>Complexity increases in the AP area, where shallow-plunging folds are refolded around a N-S fold axis; this pattern can be observed in the Mag Survey both locally in the Central Target area and at the property-scale. A second gabbro horizon with an interpreted extent of approximately 3 km hosts mineralization in the northwest part of the AP zone (Figure 1); this may represent a separate gabbro intrusion, or a complex fault/fold repetition of the main mineralized horizon. Additional work including drilling has been planned to continue to expand the system.</p><p><strong>High-Resolution Mag Survey at Central Target:</strong></p><p>PTX announced the completion of a new 3,191 line-km high-resolution Heli-GT aeromagnetic survey covering its W2 Project in January of 2025 (see press release January 22, 2025), which was completed by Scott Hogg &amp; Associates (“SHA”). High-resolution geophysical data is critical at the Central Target since the known Cu-Ni-Au-PGE mineralization at the Property is associated with coincident Mag &amp; Conductivity highs. The Mag Survey is also a key input for resolving geologic patterns as most the area is covered under glacial till.</p><p>Comparison of the old and new Mag Surveys in the Central Target area shows a subtle but critical improvement in the definition of key geologic features. Features which previously plotted as isolated blobs have now been defined as more continuous horizons (Figure 3); these linear targets have more potential for expansion along strike during exploration.  In other cases, the updated Mag Survey traces fault offsets between isolated magnetic panels, emphasizing the continuous nature of the gabbro horizon which hosts mineralization (Figure 4). These details are critical for high-quality 3D modelling and effective drill targeting.</p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/05/07040946/Picture3-1024x483.jpg" alt="Picture3" /></figure><p>Figure 3: Comparison of old and new Mag Surveys in Central Area, north of the CA zones. Black dots represent interpreted conductivity anomalies. Isolated “high-mag blobs” circled on the left resolve into more continuous linear anomalies in the modern high-resolution survey.  A cross-cutting dike is also visible in the Heli-GT survey.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/05/07040956/Picture4.png" alt="Picture4" /></figure><p>Figure 4: Comparison of old and new Mag Surveys east of the AP zone; black circles represent conductivity anomalies.  An updated fault interpretation is traced onto the new survey, which shows well-defined northwest trends bridging between the anomalies; these trends were very obscure on the old survey.</p><p><strong>Potential to expand the Central Exploration Target</strong></p><p>The updated 3D model stresses the continuous nature of the gabbro horizons, which hosts Polymetallic Cu-Ni-Au-PGE mineralization in the Central Target area with discontinuity largely a function of late fault offsets.  Many of these fault blocks are untested or tested by single holes, despite coincident Mag/conductivity anomalies similar to those in densely drilled areas.  Significant potential therefore exists to expand the Central Exploration Target by drilling in these relatively untested gabbro targets which can “link” between the existing showing areas. Examples would include the “CA_Inter” area between CA1 and CA2, the folded gabbro layers interpreted between CA2 and the AP Zones, and the gabbro west of AP (Figure 1). </p><p>Targeting and drill planning at the Central Target is under way based on the updated Mag Survey and 3D model.  An initial 20-hole drill program has been designed, with a focus on expanding the Exploration Target, defining high-value parts of the mineral system (including areas of mineralization thickening/fault imbrication), and de-risking the project through verification of historic drilling with the goal of converting parts of the Exploration Target into compliant mineral resources.</p><p><strong>Corporate Update:</strong></p><p>The Company is also pleased to announce an update to the Chief Financial Officer as part of a transition planned in February 2025. Effective, May 1, 2025, the Company’s existing Corporate Controller, Cindy Davis, has taken on an expanded role as CFO and replaced Graham Warren.</p><p>The Company would like to thank Graham for his dedication and the financial guidance he provided as CFO for PTX Metals over the last four years, which has been an active growth period for the Company. We wish him well and further success with his other CFO roles and appreciate his assistance as a consultant in the short term. Cindy Davis, taking on the expanded role, with the assistance of Marrelli Support Services Inc., will allow for a streamlined accounting and controller function.</p><p>Cindy Davis Biography: Mrs. Cindy Davis possesses over 15 years of experience of providing accounting, financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and management advisory services to publicly listed companies, through Marrelli Support Services Inc.

        content: `<p>PTX Metals Inc. (TSXV: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) (&#8220;PTX&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is pleased to announce results from the second phase drill program at the Heenan-Mallard Gold Property located in the Swayze Greenstone Belt and 45 km northwest of the IAMGOLD’s Cote Gold Mine. As a follow-up from the initial green field discovery that consisted of a limited stripping and initial four-hole drill program (see news release dated of February 21<sup>st</sup>, 2024), PTX completed an additional five drill holes aiming to test continuity of the mineralization along strike and at depth. All of drill holes intersected near-surface gold mineralization with a highlight of 75.75m at 0.50g/t Au including 5.00m at 3.93 g/t gold being intersected in drill hole HE24-06.</p><p>The recent drilling has shown sizeable intercepts in most of the drill holes, confirming expansion of a newly discovered system near IAMGOLD’s Cote Gold mine, and suggesting prospectivity for near-surface mineralized tonnage considering multiple mineralized intervals above 70m wide in core length in two drill holes. Considering step out holes, drilling has successfully intercepted new gold mineralization opening up for expanding the mineralization along strike and at depth. The bulk of the mineralization sits within the iron formation hosting a high density of felsic dikes, for which lithological contacts and structural breaks provide favorable conduits for mineral deposition. The gold mineralization has been described as being associated with pyrite and minor quartz veining.</p><p>Additionally, the Company has submitted exploration permits on its Shining Tree Property where a drill program is being planned to test the high-grade Ribble Vein at Ronda where a mechanized stripping and channel sampling program completed by PTX returned multiple channels of high-grade gold mineralization with 16.14m at 9.04g/t Au being reported in channel sampling (see press release dated of February 7<sup>th</sup>, 2024).</p><p><strong>Results highlights of the second phase drill program at Heenan:</strong></p><ul><li>The program consisted of 5 diamond drill holes totaling 693.35 m.</li><li>Combined drilling Phase 1 and 2 cumulates 1,305m for 9 holes.</li><li>Drill holes tested the down dip extension in three areas and along strike in two areas from the initial discovery made in 2024.</li><li>Mineralized system remains open along strike and at depth for potential expansion<ul><li><em>SECTION A:</em> Following up the initial interception of 77.44m at 0.40 g/t Au from 2024 drill program, the hole HE24-05 is spaced 50m deeper and is demonstrating multiple intercepts such as 5.0m at 0.84g/t Au or 3.0m at 0.82 g/t Au, occurring mostly at lithological contacts.</li></ul><ul><li><em>SECTION B:</em> Similarly to section A, considering approximately a 30m distance between both HE23-03 and HE24-06, a wider zone of 75.75m at 0.50g/t Au was intercepted below the 2024 results of 27.15m at 0.55 g/t Au (see figure 1 below).</li></ul></li></ul><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2025/04/15161043/image-1-1024x503.png" alt="Image 1" /></figure><p>Figure 1: Section A and B showing intersections in 4 holes and extension of the mineralization at depth.

        content: `<p><strong>PTX Metals Inc. (TSXV: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (“<strong>PTX</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>“), a mineral exploration company focused on high-quality Cu-Ni-PGE and gold projects in northern Ontario, is pleased to announce the commencement of a Phase 2 program at its 100% owned W2 Cu-Ni-PGE Project (W2 Project) along with plans for subsequent work programs. The W2 Project is a 22,000-hectare property located directly southwest of the Ring of Fire, Ontario.</p><p><strong><u>Drilling Program:</u></strong></p><p>The Phase 2 drill program consists of up to 10 holes that are designed to test and expand zones of mineralization in the CA_1 and CA_2 in the Central Target Area. Preliminary results from the first five holes drilled have shown intercepts of visible mineralization as disseminated, semi-massive to massive sulfides over significant widths. Assay results have yet to be received.  </p><p>A key priority is bringing the exploration target outline of September 4<sup>th</sup>, 2024, to a potential mineral resource estimate and expansion of mineralization in the “Interzone” located between the CA_1 and CA_2 zones, that could cumulate 4 km strike length. (see Figure below).</p><p>Drill targets were generated from a newly developed 3D geological model led by SunDog Geology over the Central Target focused on the CA Zones. A similar model will be completed on the AP zones in April. This new interpretation will lead to expanding the mineralized corridor of the CA zones toward the northeast de-risking further work spending.</p><p>Additionally, the Company has completed a property-wide HeliGT Magnetic Survey (“Mag Survey”) of <a>3,191 line-km</a>, for which both the 3D geological model and the Mag survey results will be announced shortly. Such compilation aims to build confidence in growing a larger mineralized system starting with the Central Target and simultaneously defining new areas of interest across the W2 Project.

The company received drill permits from MINES on June 14<sup>th</sup>, 2023, and November 29<sup>th</sup>, 2024 (see news release dated June 19, 2023, and December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2024).</p><p><strong><u>Work Plan &amp; Company Technical Strategy</u></strong></p><p>The Company has undertaken steps since consolidation of the W2 Project to de-risk and increase value of the asset &#8211; starting with validation of historical data, including consolidation of the database, an initial exploration target outline, and a Phase 1 step out and expansion drill program primarily in the AP zones and regionally carried out in 2024. The program was successful in intersecting magmatic Cu-Ni sulfide mineralization across the Project (see news release dated July 24<sup>th</sup> and July 30<sup>th</sup>, 2024).</p><p>Currently the Company is focused on additional drilling, improving targeting by implementing geophysical surveys, and expanding the current geological model, all of which will be followed up by ground truthing and further drill programs.</p><p>As a result, the Company is undertaking the following steps for the spring and summer:</p><ul><li>Developing additional targets defined by the Magnetic Survey review and data compilation.</li><li>Undertake a geophysical IP survey over the CA zones to resolve the geophysical response of the disseminated, semi-massive to massive sulfide mineralization and test for continuity beyond the areas of historic drilling.</li><li>Additional drilling on CA interzone aiming to complete the connection between known mineralized zones, which were previously identified by historical drilling.</li><li>Field mapping and ground truthing in areas of coincident magnetic and AEM anomalies on the property which have never been tested previously within the Central Target as well as at the property scale.</li><li>Age dating on gabbro samples from its 2024 and 2025 drill program to determine if the mafic intrusions hosting Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization at W2 are the same age as the mafic-ultramafic intrusions in the Ring of Fire.

(CSE: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (&#8220;<strong>PTX</strong>&#8221; or the &#8220;<strong>Company</strong>&#8220;) is pleased to announce that it has received conditional approval from the TSX Venture Exchange (&#8220;TSXV&#8221;) for the listing of its common shares as a Tier 2 Mining Issuer (the &#8220;Listing&#8221;). The Listing remains subject to the Company meeting certain standard conditions required by the TSXV, which the Company is actively working to satisfy. A further press release will be issued upon receipt of final approval.</p><p>In connection with the Listing, the Company intends to voluntarily delist its common shares from the Canadian Securities Exchange (the &#8220;CSE&#8221;) (the &#8220;Delisting&#8221;). The Delisting is subject to the applicable requirements of the CSE and is expected to take effect once trading of the Company&#8217;s common shares begins on the TSXV. The Company will provide an update confirming the expected Listing date on the TSXV and the Delisting date from the CSE, once determined.</p><p><strong>&#8220;The CSE has been a great platform for the Company, and we appreciate the support we have received. However, we have listened to feedback from our stakeholders and believe that listing on the TSXV will better align with our long-term growth strategy while facilitating further investment and trading by our institutional, European, and US stakeholders,&#8221; said Greg Ferron, President and CEO of PTX. Additionally, the Company is pleased to provide an update on the results of its annual general and special meeting of shareholders held on February 25, 2025 (the &#8220;Meeting&#8221;). At the Meeting, the shareholders of the Company re-elected James R. Trusler, Frederico Marques, Christophe Vereecke, Greg Ferron, Sam Kiri, Rajesh Sharma, and Jean-David Moore to the Company&#8217;s board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;), and re-appointed Baker Tilly WM LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, as the auditor of the Company.</strong><br></p><p>Furthermore, shareholders of the Company also approved the adoption of an omnibus long-term incentive plan (the &#8220;Omnibus Plan&#8221;), effective as of February 25, 2025. The Omnibus Plan replaces the Company&#8217;s &#8220;rolling&#8221; stock option plan (the &#8220;Option Plan&#8221;), which reserved a maximum of 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from time to time for issuance upon the exercise of options. Under the Omnibus Plan, in addition to those awards and options granted under the former plan, restricted share units and performance share units will now also be granted, all governed by a single plan document. The Board is of the view that the Omnibus Plan will allow different types of incentives to be granted to certain officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company.<br></p><p>Further information regarding the Omnibus Plan can be found in the Company&#8217;s management information circular dated January 13, 2025, filed under its SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca.</p><p>The voting results, as set out in the scrutineer&#8217;s report for the Meeting, were as follows:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Motions</td><td>Votes For</td><td>% For</td><td>Votes Withheld</td><td>% Withheld</td></tr><tr><td>Appointment of Auditors</td><td>39,562,922</td><td>100%</td><td>1,250</td><td>0.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Greg Ferron</td><td>39,562,922</td><td>100%</td><td>1,250</td><td>0.00%</td></tr><tr><td>James R.

In addition, a final closing of the Private Placement is expected to occur on or about December 18, 2024.</p><p>Pursuant to the closing of the First Tranche, the Company issued 16,603,715 FT Shares at a price of \$0.14 per FT Share for aggregate gross proceeds of \$2,324,520. Each FT Share will qualify as a &#8220;flow-through share&#8221; as defined in subsection 66(15) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> (Canada).</p><p>Also pursuant to the closing of the First Tranche, the Company issued 5,578,000 Units at a price of \$0.125 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of \$697,250.

The issuances to the Participating Insiders constitutes a “related party transaction” within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101-Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”) The Company has relied on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 contained in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101 in respect of related party participation in the Private Placement as neither the fair market value (as determined under MI 61-101) of the subject matter of, nor the fair market value of the consideration for, the transaction, insofar as it involved the related party, exceeded 25% of the Company&#8217;s market capitalization (as determined under MI 61-101). A material change report will be filed in connection with the Private Placement less than 21 days in advance of closing of the First Tranche, as the nature of the related party transaction is relatively immaterial, and was not necessary to complete the Offering, and can generally be considered reasonable in the circumstances.</p><p>All securities issued in connection with this Private Placement will be subject to a four month plus one day hold period from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities laws.</p><p><strong><u>About PTX Metals Inc.:</u></strong></p><p>PTX is a mineral exploration company focused on high-quality critical minerals projects, including two flagship projects situated in northern Ontario, renowned as a world-class mining jurisdiction for its abundance of mineral resources and investment opportunities.

Potential drilling of high priority targets could occur as early as 2025 once permitting is in place.</p><p><strong><u>Overview of Uranium Geology in Amer Lake and Baker Lake:</u></strong></p><p>Uranium mineralization in the Amer Lake terrane can be classified into four main types:</p><ol><li>Syngenetic mineralization found near the contact between the Showing Lake and Oora Lake formations. This style of mineralization is characterized by pore-filling and fine disseminations of uraninite, chalcopyrite, magnetite and calcite in pink, sandy layers of the siltstone. The grade of this syngenetic mineralization is generally low (&lt;0.05% U3O8).</li><li>Unconformity-vein type mineralization (discovered in boulders and outcrop) occurs as narrow stockwork veins cross-cutting Amer Group rocks. Mineralized veins are commonly associated with illite, chlorite and hematite alteration Grades for unconformity-vein type mineralization discovered in boulders can be high. Grab samples of > 10% U3O8 have been reported from the area.</li><li>Sandstone-hosted phosphatic (matrix of the sandstone or phosphatic breccia) and non-phosphatic mineralization has been located in float with concentrations of uranium ranging from 0.01% to 1.0% U3O8. The non-phosphatic boulders are limonitic, vuggy and contain secondary uranium minerals such as torbernite and autunite.</li><li>Structurally-controlled (fault and/or dyke) mineralization such as Orano’s Kiggavik project and Forum’s recently enhanced Tatiggaq project, both of which have encountered much higher grades than currently observed in the Amer Group rocks.</li><li>Grab samples of > 10% U3O8 have been reported from the area. Amer Lake North hosts 5 uranium prospects, Wolverine Point, 76-5, 76-2 and 77-2 and a new discovery all of which present as till anomalies and/or uriniferous boulder anomalies.</li></ol><p>Uranium Mineralization in the Baker Lake region can be classified as:</p><ol><li>Structurally controlled/hosted encountered in fractured and brecciated fractured/faulted conglomerates and arkoses of the Baker Lake Basin. e.g Kazan Sandstone or South Channel Conglomerate, containing some fracture filling disseminated pitchblende in salvages associated with these structures</li><li>Unconformity-vein type mineralization (discovered in boulders and outcrop) occurs as narrow stockwork veins cross-cutting Baker Lake Group rocks and into stratigraphically underlying basement rocks of Archean age.</li><li>Volcanic basement hosted shears (volcanic) (Beaverlodge-style) with minor graphite and hematization was noted in the basement rocks which are also commonly fractured and sheared.</li></ol><p>Elliot Lake Claims:</p><p>GCC is in the process of letting these claims lapse to manage costs and focus its priorities on Nunavut and on other opportunities.</p><p>Muskrat Dam Project:</p><p>GCC recently issued 166,667 common shares at 15 cents per share to an arm’s length party related to final anniversary payment.</p><p>Qualified person</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Rhys Davies, PGeo for GCC, a consulting geologist of GCC and qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 &#8212; Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p>About PTX Metals Inc.</p><p>PTX is a minerals exploration Company focused on high-quality critical mineral projects, including two flagship projects situated in northern Ontario, renowned as a world-class mining jurisdiction for its abundance of mineral resources and investment opportunities.

(CSE: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) (“PTX” or the “Company”), a minerals exploration Company with two flagship projects situated in northern Ontario, is pleased to provide the results of a technical report summarizing the Exploration Target model estimate for the 100% owned W2 Cu-Ni-PGE Project in Ontario which outlines a large scale <strong>near-surface</strong> Cu-Ni-PGE project near the Ring of Fire area, Ontario.</p><p>The Company’s 3D geological and grade shell modelling of historic and recent drilling results indicates a near-surface exploration target of approximately <strong>59-135 million tonnes (“Mt”)</strong> averaging between <strong>0.78% to 1.03% CuEq</strong>, containing some <strong>610,000 tonnes to 1,052,000 tonnes Copper Equivalent (“CuEq”) </strong>(using CuEq grade higher than 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively). This is equivalent to 1.34 billion to 2.3 billion pounds Copper Equivalent.</p><p>Using CuEq grade higher than 0.9%, the exploration target estimation is <strong>31 million tonnes at 1.25% CuEq.</strong></p><p>In total, five mineralization zones &#8211; CA Zone 1, CA Zone 2, AP Main and two satellite zones (AP North and AP East) were defined from the Exploration Targets models (Figure 1). The five mineralization zones have an extended strike length of approximately 7 km and are mostly near surface (&lt;150m deep), but open at depth. All drillhole databases were compiled into The GEOVIA GEMS database which consisted of 98 drill holes totalling 16,841 metres completed by Inco, Aurora Platinum, and PTX Metals.</p><p><strong>Highlight of the Results:</strong></p><ul><li>The recently acquired CA Zones (CA Zone 1 and CA Zone 2) are estimated to have a potential for 24 million tonnes at 0.98% Cu Eq (using CuEq grader higher than 0.7%).</li><li>The CA Zone 2 located to the southeast reported the highest grade of 2 MT at 1.42% CuEq (using grade higher than 0.9% CuEq for estimation).</li><li>Higher PGEs (Pd, Pt etc.) are noted in the AP Main Zone, which is estimated to have a potential for 20 million tonnes at 1.25% CuEq using grade higher than 0.9% CuEq for estimation.</li><li>There are many undrilled conductors throughout the property (Figure 1) and the 2024 phase 1 drilling revealed zones of previously unknown mineralization over wide widths across a 7 km strike on the property.</li><li>In addition, the 2024 Phase 1 drilling was successful in confirming historical mineralization.</li><li>Next steps for the project include confirmation drilling principally where Inco drilled in the CA zones and infill drilling in the AP zone, metallurgy and further community engagement. All of these activities should enhance confidence in the deposit potential and considerably derisk the project.</li></ul><p>“We are delighted with the results of this initial work showing the significant scale of the W2 project and the potential to become a mining project of significance,” said Greg Ferron, CEO and President of PTX Metals Inc. “The tonnage and grade reported substantially benefitted from the high-quality drilling completed by Inco, Aurora Platinum and PTX.

In addition, a portion of the historical drilling assay data predates the implementation of NI 43-101. This was the rationale for estimating the model as an Exploration Target.</em></p><p><em>The exploration target modeling work followed the guidelines set forth in National Instrument 43-101, Section 14 resource estimate, and will also be used to inform further exploration drill program strategies at W2 such as confirmation drilling and in-fill drilling. The potential grade and tonnage of the exploration target model is conceptual in nature, and more work and information, including drilling, are required before fulfilling CIM (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum) requirements for the disclosure of an eventual mineral resource. At this stage, it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the Exploration Target being delineated as a Mineral Resource. In addition, important aspects such as metallurgical processing options need to be investigated to evaluate potential recoveries in the mineralized zones.</em></p><p><strong>Methodology</strong></p><p>The Exploration Target has been completed by BAW Mining Inc., a consultant independent of the Company and has been completed in accordance with National Instrument 43-10 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101). The completed NI 43-101 technical report will be filed on Sedar and Company’s website within 45 days of the date of this news release.</p><p>Five mineralization zones &#8211; CA Zone 1, CA Zone 2, AP Main and two satellite zones (AP North and AP East) were determined from the Exploration Targets (Figure 1). The five mineralization zones have an extended strike length of approximately 7 km and are mostly near surface (&lt;150m deep), but open to depth. The mineralized zones were estimated by generating 3-D grade-shell geological and mineralization wireframes using 7 drill holes completed by PTX in 2024 and historical drill holes which were collected and digitized from various documents. The entire drillhole databases were compiled into The GEOVIA GEMS™ V6.8.4 database which consisted of 98 drill holes totalling 16,841 metres.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="6"><strong>Table 2<br>W2 Drill Hole Database Summary</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Year<br>Drilled</strong></td><td><strong># Of<br>Drill Holes</strong></td><td><strong>Drill Hole<br>Length<br>(m)</strong></td><td><strong># Of Holes<br>Used for ET<br>Reporting</strong></td><td><strong>Length Of Holes<br>Used for ET<br>Reporting (m)</strong></td><td><strong># Of<br>Assayed<br>Drill Holes</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>7</td><td>1,545</td><td>5</td><td>1,189</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Historical</td><td>91</td><td>15,296</td><td>46</td><td>8,386</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>98</td><td>16,841</td><td>51</td><td>9,575</td><td>68</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Based on the available lithology and assay information, the mineralization is hosted mostly within gabbro. A gabbro 3D model was created using a regional geological map, drill hole lithology and assay data available within the PTX claims. The mineralization wireframe was refined from grade boundary interpretation constrained within the gabbro from visual inspection of drill hole sections. The outlines were influenced by the selection of mineralized material above 0.3% copper equivalence (CuEq) that demonstrated a lithological and structural zonal continuity along strike and down dip. The CuEq was calculated with the formula below:</p><p><strong><em>*CuEq%=Cu%+(2.212*Ni%)+(3.658*Co%)+(0.435*Pd g/t)+(0.365*Pt g/t)+(0.770*Au g/t)</em></strong></p><p>The CuEq was determined with metal prices only and metallurgical recovery was not estimated since no metallurgical test has been done to date on the project.</p><p>The database contains lithology of all drill holes and assays of 68 holes (see Table 2). Drill hole locations are shown in Figure 1. The collar elevation (Z) of the historical holes were pressed onto the topographic surface created based on the USGS Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation data as the elevation were not available in the source documents.</p><p><strong>Metal prices are based on a one-year trailing average as of April 30, 2024, as follows:</strong></p><p>Cu Price US\$3.82/lb<br>Ni Price US\$8.45/lb<br>Co Price US\$13.97/lb<br>Pd Price US\$1,138/oz<br>Pt Price US\$957/oz<br>Au Price US\$2,016/oz</p><p>The minimum constrained sample length for the wireframes was 2.0 m. In some cases, mineralization below 0.3% CuEq was included for the purpose of maintaining zonal continuity and minimum width.</p><p>Five mineralization zones (CA1, CA2, AP, AP_North and AP_East) were determined for the Exploration Targets with a minimum of three assay holes spacing less than 500 m, extending 100 m from the outmost holes into untested territories. Most drillholes, especially in the CA zones, have tighter drilling hole spacing than the minimum drillhole spacing above. The 3-D domains are presented in Figure 1. To estimate the tonnage of the mineralized zones, a specific gravity (“SG”) of 3 t/m3 was assumed as there weren’t any bulk density measurements available to this study.</p><p>The surfaces of topography and overburden were created with USGS SRTM elevation data and drill hole logs, and the mineralization domains were truncated to the overburden surface.</p><p>The grade blocks of Cu, Ni, Co, Pd, Pt and Au were interpolated with Inverse Distance Squared (“ID<sup>2</sup>”). Nearest Neighbour (“NN”) was employed for validation. Multiple passes were executed for the grade interpolation to progressively capture the sample points to avoid over-smoothing and preserve local grade variability. Search ranges and directions were based on the variograms.</p><p><strong>W2 Exploration Potential</strong></p><p>The Company intends to test the validity of the Exploration Target models in future exploration programs on the Project. Systematic diamond drilling (NQ core size) of the known mineralized zones together with geophysical surveys to prioritize targets will be conducted and extended over a several-year period. Primary focus will be:</p><p>&#8211; Confirmation and infill drilling in both CA and AP zone.<br>&#8211; Exploration drilling for expansion along strike and at depth in both CA and AP zone.<br>&#8211; Exploration drilling in the transition area between the five zones.<br>&#8211; Drill testing numerous previously undrilled EM conductors on the property.<br>&#8211; More detailed airborne and ground geophysical surveys, such as Mag and EM surveys and interpretation.</p><p><strong>Figure 1 W2 Exploration Target Zones</strong></p><figure><a href="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/09/04091814/2024-09-04-ptx-fig-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/09/04091814/2024-09-04-ptx-fig-1.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure><p>Selected cross-sections of the CuEq blocks are presented in Figure 2 and 3.</p><p><strong>Figure 2 CA1 Zone Longitudinal Projection</strong></p><figure><a href="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/09/04091812/2024-09-04-ptx-fig-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/09/04091812/2024-09-04-ptx-fig-2.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure><p><strong>(CuEq Block vs Drill Hole)</strong></p><p><strong>Figure 3 AP Zone Longitudinal Projection</strong></p><figure><a href="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/09/04091810/2024-09-04-ptx-fig-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/09/04091810/2024-09-04-ptx-fig-3.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure><p><strong>(CuEq Block vs Drill Hole)</strong></p><p><strong><u>Qualified Person</u></strong></p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Yungang Wu, P.

The program was for preparation of drilling and other exploration activities.</p><p><strong><u>Highlights include:</u></strong></p><ul><li>During June and early July, the South Timmins Joint Venture completed mechanized stripping and channel sampling programs on the Shining Tree Gold Project covering an area of 2,971 m<sup>2</sup> , bringing the total area stripped in Phase 1 to 4,883 m<sup>2</sup>  .  This had led to several new quartz-carbonate vein systems being uncovered, with channel sample results ranging from 0.01 g/t to 5.18 g/t Au.</li><li>A 20 m wide north-northeast orientated altered shear zone was uncovered approximately 500 m south of Ronda containing anomalous gold mineralization and discovery of a 3-4 m wide northwest orientated quartz-carbonate vein system that was uncovered 700 m northeast of Ronda, and immediately south of Caswell Lake.</li><li>At Heenan, a total of 9 select channel samples were collected over 25 cm lengths from Stripped Area #2, with 4 of the 9 samples returning > 2.00 g/t Au, with a high of 5.77 g/t Au.</li><li>Successfully completed the exploration activities for Phase 1 of the Joint Venture agreement and planning is underway for the earn-in and Phase 2 exploration program.</li><li>PTX has appointed Erika Dohring as a technical committee member of the South Timmins JV.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Shining Tree:</u></strong></p><p>Stripping targeted anomalous grab and geochemical (B-Horizon) samples, as well as exposed bedrock geology in select areas. A total of five areas totaling 2,971 m<sup>2</sup> were mechanically stripped, washed, channel sampled, and geologically mapped. In total, 117 channel samples were collected and submitted for analysis and results range from 0.01 g/t to 5.18 g/t Au.</p><p>This recent program has allowed for a better understanding of the geological controls on mineralization at surface at Ronda and leading to the discovery of new gold-bearing structures in the surrounding area. </p><p>Highlights from the recent stripping program include the discovery of a 3-4 m wide northwest orientated quartz-carbonate vein system that was uncovered 700 m northeast of Ronda, and immediately south of Caswell Lake. This structure contained abundant pyrite associated with carbonate and quartz veinlets and may represent a northwest continuation of the Saville Vein or a Saville-type vein system onto the Shining Tree Property. Anomalous gold mineralization was reported with results ranging from 0.01 g/t over 1.00 m to 1.16 g/t Au over 1.00 m.</p><p>Approximately 150 m southeast of Ronda, discrete quartz-carbonate veins hosted within mafic volcanics were uncovered.  Samples returned 0.01 g/t Au over 1.00 m to 5.18 g/t Au over 0.70 m. </p><p>Stripping 500 m south of Ronda has also identified an approximate 20 m wide north-northeast orientated shear zone that contains anomalous gold mineralization ranging from 0.01 to 1.46 g/t Au over 1.00 m sample lengths, with a highlight of 1.29 g/t Au over 2.00 m. This structure has been interpreted as the southern extension of the nearby Ribble Structure at Ronda, and likely connects with the Foisey Vein located 1.3 km south of the Ribble Vein/Ronda Mine.</p><p>Approximately 250 m northeast of Ronda, a northeast orientated shear zone containing quartz-carbonate veining exposed over an approximate width of 20 m was uncovered. Anomalous gold values were also returned that ranged from 0.01 to 0.34 g/t Au over 0.50 m channel sample lengths.</p><p><strong><u>Heenan Mallard:</u></strong></p><p>At Heenan, a total of 9 channel samples were collected from Stripped Area #2, with results ranging from 0.51 g/t to 5.77 g/t Au over 0.25 m sample lengths. The detailed sampling was collected proximal to a channel sample intercept from the fall of 2023 that returned 2.08 g/t Au over 8.00 m and several consistent wide zones of gold mineralization intersected from surface to 177m including:</p><ul><li>77.44 m of 0.40 g/tonne Gold in hole HE23-02</li><li>27.15 m of 0.55 g/tonne Gold in hole HE23-03</li><li>An additional zone of mineralization, outside the iron formation, was encountered in hole 2 grading 5.53 g/tonne over one meter at 177 m.</li></ul><p>At Mallard, an area of approximately 1,022 m<sup>2</sup> was mechanically stripped in two areas. On the main stripped area, totaling 928 m<sup>2</sup>, a quartz-carbonate altered mafic volcanic rock was uncovered in contact with a quartz-feldspar porphyry, a similar geological setting as what has been reported at the Camp and River Zones located approximately 600 m to the northwest. A total of 51 channel samples were completed with anomalous gold values obtained in the samples that ranged from &lt;0.005 to 0.98 g/t Au over 0.75 to 1.00 m sample lengths, with a composite of 0.67 g/t Au over 4.00 m being sampled at the edge of the outcrop where it is in contact with an interpreted overburden-filled structure.</p><p><strong><u>New Technical Committee Member:</u></strong></p><p>The Company is also pleased to bring in a new technical committee member to assist in the next phase of exploration activities at the South Timmins Gold Projects. Erika Dohring is replacing Blaine Webster as exploration activities have advanced. Blaine will continue to assist the Company as a technical advisor.</p><p>Mrs. Dohring holds a M.Sc. in geology and mining engineering from LaSalle Beauvais (France) and grew into a career with exposure from field to capital market, and most recently as an entrepreneur. Over the years, Mrs. Dohring has built her expertise across three continents working for junior and major companies with primary focus on precious and base metals.

(CSE: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) (“PTX” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce additional drill results from the 1,544 metre diamond drill program on its 100% owned W2 Cu-Ni-PGE Project (“W2” or “W2 Project”), which covers the whole layered Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (LHIC), located in the “Ring of Fire” region of Northwestern Ontario. This drilling program did not include drilling of the recently acquired claims which include the historical resource area known primarily as the Inco Area (“CA”) Zones nor the previously defined W2 Cu-Ni-PGE Deposit (see image – Figure 1 plan view).</p><p>In addition, the Company has completed the 1D exploration program in June and July at the South Timmins Joint Venture projects on Shining Tree and Heenan and Mallard Gold Projects and gold assays will be reported next week (see press release dated June 12, 2024).</p><p>The W2 drill holes included both geophysical targets as well as new targets identified from in-house geological and geophysical interpretations. The exploration holes were designed to test the expansion potential of the W2 near surface mineralization trend (identified by 84 historical drill hole results over approximately 7 km), as well as an associated EM (electromagnetic) geophysical trend.</p><p>Holes W224-04 to -06 were drilled to infill and confirm the mineralization. Confirmation drilling provides additional data and enhances confidence in the historical reported mineralization zones (Transition and AP zones – see Figure 1). These holes have increased PTX’s geological confidence in the mineralized zones’ continuity. Drill holes W224-01 to W224-03 and drill holes W224-07 were exploration drillholes targeting new areas reaching as far as 28 km from the CA zone (see press release on July 24, 2024).</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong><strong></strong></p><ul><li>Three confirmation drill holes (W224-04, W224-05, and W224-06) successfully confirmed over 7 km near-surface Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization, primarily in the AP zone and transition zone located between the two CA Zones<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.</li><li>Drill hole W224-04 &#8211; The positive outcomes of these drill holes have substantially increased PTX’s geological confidence in the deposit’s continuity.</li><li>Drillhole W224-04 intercepted a PGE-dominant upper anomalous zone, with 0.41g/t PGE (Pt+Pd) over 3.00 m starting at 64.00 m.</li><li>Below this interval, the drill hole intercepted a thick Cu-Ni-dominated zone similar to those intersected in several nearby historical holes (e.g., 54017-0: 1.22% Cu Eq over 58.3 m, LH01-02: 0.92% Cu Eq over 42.6 m, LH01-20: 0.54% Cu Eq over 45.0 m).</li><li>This lower thicker intercept in W224-04 consists of 0.47% Cu Eq over 46.00 m from 85.00 to 131.00 m, including 0.61% Cu Eq over 13.84 m starting from 117.16 m, with 1.46% Cu Eq over 3.84 m starting from 117.16 m</li><li>Drillhole W224-05 intercepted a near surface cumulative 82.84 m of Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization from three separate mineralization zones starting from 32.87 m; including,<ul><li>67.01 m at 0.44% Cu Eq starting at 32.87 m,</li></ul><ul><li>including 7.50 m at 0.70% Cu Eq starting at 71.50 m.</li></ul></li><li>Drillhole W224-06 intercepted a cumulative 39.20 m of mineralization from several separate mineralization zones starting from 27.00 m.<ul><li>Highlights include 0.62 % Cu Eq over 4.20 m starting at 62.00 m,</li></ul><ul><li>including 1.44 % Cu Eq over 1.60 m.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (“LHIC”), which has been emplaced in the Volcano-sedimentary sequences of the Bartman Lake Greenstone Belt (BLGB), is host to Cu-Ni-PGE and V-Ti oxide mineralization similar to layered complexes (e.g., Bushveld, S.

        content: `<p>TORONTO, July 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – PTX Metals Inc. (CSE: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) (“PTX” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide partial drill results from the 1,544 metre diamond drill program, on its 100% owned W2 Cu-Ni-PGE Project (“W2” or “W2 Project”) which is covering the whole layered Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (LHIC), located in the “Ring of Fire” region of Northwestern Ontario. This drilling program did not include drilling of the recently acquired claims which include the historical resource area known primarily as the Inco Area (“CA”) Zones nor the previously defined W2 Cu-Ni-PGE Deposit (see image – Figure 1 plan view).</p><p>The drill holes included both geophysical targets as well as new targets identified from in-house geological and geophysical interpretations. The exploration holes were designed to test the expansion potential of the W2 near surface mineralization trend (identified by 84 historical drill hole results over approximately 7 km), as well as an associated EM (electromagnetic) geophysical trend.</p><p>Notably, drill holes W224-01 to W224-03 and drill holes W224-07 were exploration drillholes targeting new areas reaching as far as 28 km from the CA zones.</p><p>Holes W224-04 to -06 were drilled to infill and confirm the mineralization and will be reported separately. Confirmation drilling provides additional data and enhances confidence in the historical reported mineralization zones (Transition and AP zones – see Figure 1). These holes have increased PTX’s geological confidence in the mineralized zones’ continuity.</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong><strong></strong></p><ul><li>W224-03 – an exploration drill hole which successfully expanded the central mineralized trend by over 3 km from the center of the Aurora Platinum (“AP”) Zone. The hole significantly demonstrates excellent potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones along the contact of the gabbroic intrusive in areas that have seen limited historical exploration.</li><li>As well, this drill hole (W224-03) intersected three distinct mineralized zones for a total cumulative length of 136.76 m starting at 54.24 m, including:</li><li>88.76 m at 0.47% Cu Eq starting at 54.24 m within a wider zone of 0.41% Cu Eq over 112.76 m,<ul><li> includes 10.00 m at 0.97% Cu Eq starting at 133.00 m,</li></ul><ul><li>4.50 m at 1.65% Cu Eq starting at 137.50m,</li></ul></li><li>Deeper in the hole, also intersected,<ul><li>24.00 m at 0.52% Cu Eq starting at 188.00 m,</li></ul><ul><li>including 12.00 m at 0.76% Cu Eq at 188.00 m and</li></ul><ul><li>5.00 m at 0.97% Cu Eq starting at 194.00 m.</li></ul></li><li>Three confirmation drill holes (W224-04, W224-05, and W224-06) successfully confirmed over 7 km near-surface Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization, primarily in the AP zone and transition zone located between the two CA Zones<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.</li><li>W224-07 &#8211; a step-out hole at least 500 m away from any historical drillholes, was designed to test geophysical targets between the CA Zones. This drill hole expanded CA Zone mineralization and intercepted several broad mineralized zones over a cumulative length of 130.84 m.<ul><li>Importantly, it increases the potential to link the two CA zones into one larger continuous mineralized zone. The two CA zones&#8217; current strike is ~2.5 km and were added to the claims package through an acquisition by PTX.</li></ul></li><li>W224-07 &#8211; Intervals from this drill hole with significant Cu mineralization include:</li><li>0.59% Cu Eq over 14.00 m starting at 178.00 m,</li><li>0.79% Cu Eq over 6.55 m starting at 181.45 m within a broader wide zone of 0.30% Cu Eq over 94.00 m starting at 98.00 m, </li><li>Also, closer to surface starting at 64.00 m, the drill hole intersected 0.33% Cu Eq over 12.00 m, including 0.72% Cu Eq over 2.00 m starting at 67.00 m.</li><li>In addition, from 17.16 m the hole intersected 0.23% Cu Eq over 24.84 m.</li><li>W224-02 &#8211; In the eastern area of the W2 project, which has never been drilled before, this exploration drill hole discovered a new mafic-ultramafic intrusive system characterized by 4.5 km long strong EM anomalies. As well, it is located approximately 10 km east of the CA zone, and intersected relatively low-grade copper, nickel, and cobalt mineralization (see Figure 2).</li></ul><p>“Completion of the Phase 1 drill program was an important milestone for W2 and PTX Metals as it not only proved the exploration potential of this large package in one of Canada’s emerging and important mineralized regions, but it also served to strengthen the Company’s exploration team and community relations,” said Greg Ferron, CEO and President of PTX Metals Inc. “In addition, during the drill program we successfully completed the acquisition of a large deposit located in the central area (i.e., CA zones) of the project, which had seen significant shallow historical drilling to identify mineralized deposits; sufficient enough to support the current modelling program which includes generating 3-D shell geological and mineralization models, and to provide a range of grade and tonnage of the mineralization.</p><p>“Notably, W224-03 and W224-07 from this Phase 1 program demonstrate the high success rate of discovering new mineralization over wide widths by drilling new conductors, which are abundant across the property. Furthermore, this highlights the potential to expand or identify new Cu-Ni-PGE deposits within the large claim package.”   </p><p>The Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (“LHIC”), which has been emplaced in the Volcano-sedimentary sequences of the Bartman Lake Greenstone Belt (BLGB), is host to Cu-Ni-PGE and V-Ti oxide mineralization similar to layered complexes (e.g., Bushveld, S.

Several zones of significant sulphide mineralization (disseminated, semi-massive, and massive) were intersected, with the highlight 112.76m of 0.41 % Cu Eq starting at 54.24 m, including 10 m at 0.96% Cu Eq and 4.5 m at 1.65% Cu Eq.<a></a></p><p>Drill hole W224-07 was collared to test geophysical targets between the CA Zones. This drill hole, at least 500m away from any historical drillholes, intersected significant sulphide mineralization, significantly extending the known mineralization between the CA Zones.

W224-07 also intersected 24.84 m at 0.23% Cu Eq from 17.16 m.</p><p>Drill hole W224-02 was collared to test a large (continuous over 4.5 km) airborne VTEM conductive zone with corresponding magnetic high located approximately 10 km east of the CA Zone. Positive magnetic anomalies were explained by the discovery of a mafic-ultramafic intrusive system. Anomalous Cu mineralization over 100 m was intersected by the drill hole, with the highlight being 0.57% Cu Eq over a core length of 0.25 m starting at 57.25 m, hosted within a gabbroic unit.</p><p>Drill hole W224-01, located ~28 km east of the centre of the CA zone, was collared to test a VTEM conductive zone.

The properties include the Shining Tree, Heenan and Mallard gold projects, all located along the Ridout-Tyrell Deformation Zone in Ontario’s mineral-rich Abitibi greenstone belt. The South Timmins JV will continue with a prioritized program which will start in May and prepare for drilling at the projects later in 2024.</p><p>The work program will continue to follow a comprehensive strategy following the successful results reported from the first three programs, completed in 2023 and 2024, which validated the exploration strategy and included a new gold discovery in the Swayze Greenstone belt at Heenan and the confirmation of high-grade gold mineralization through stripping and channel sampling at Shining Tree.</p><p>The work programs will expand surface stripping at Heenan to follow up on drill results (see press release February 21, 2024) and additional stripping and channel sampling on a wider surface area at Ronda (Shining Tree) to follow up on the anomalous high-grade sample results (see press release February 7, 2024). The Spring 2024 programs will also include stripping and channel sampling on the Mallard Project where prospecting last year uncovered gold mineralization 500 m southeast of the Camp Zone, representing a possible extension of the structure that hosts the Camp Zone, or a sub-parallel structure. Work at Mallard will also prepare for drilling at the Camp and River zones discovered by Noranda Exploration Co. Ltd. (see press release dated October 18, 2023). These zones targeted gold mineralization hosted within two northwest-oriented shear zones that are interpreted as splays of the Ridout Deformation Zone which is located south of the Mallard Property.</p><p>“The Swayne and Shining Tree gold camps are enjoying a lot of attention with the commissioning of IAMGOLD’s  Côté Gold Mine, and the South Timmins JV is keen to further advance PTX’s gold assets immediately adjacent to this new mine,” says Greg Ferron, President and CEO of PTX Metals Inc. “In the first year, since the acquisition of these projects and the formation of the Joint Venture, our exploration strategy has been rewarded with the successful discovery of new gold at Heenan and validation of high-grade surface mineralization at Ronda. Naturally, we are excited to drill Mallard and follow up on the high-grade discovery made by Noranda.”</p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/05/26175418/Picture1-1024x499.jpg" alt="Picture1" /></figure><p>Figure 1 Location map of Shining Tree, Heenan and Mallard J-V Gold projects</p><p><strong><u>Qualified Person</u></strong></p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Joerg Kleinboeck, P.Geo., a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p><strong><u>About the Shining Tree, </u></strong><strong><u>Heenan and Mallard Properties</u></strong></p><p>The Shining Tree Project is a district-scale gold property located within the prolific Abitibi greenstone belt, renowned for its concentration of high-grade gold as well as copper, silver and zinc deposits.

(CSE: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) (“PTX” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide an update on the Company’s inaugural drill program at the W2 Cu-Ni-PGE Project (“W2” or the “Project”) in the “Ring of Fire” region of Northwestern Ontario with the Phase 1 Drill Program proceeding well. Further, modelling of the complete historical resource area is underway with a goal to produce a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate following the completion of an additional Phase 2 drill program.  This process has been enabled by the recent acquisition and consolidation of the historical resource area.</p><p><strong><u>Drill Program:</u></strong></p><p>Progress on the two-phased 2,500-metre drill campaign at W2 is proceeding well. Operations are centered in Webequie, Ontario where the Company has established its exploration base. The program was designed to test high-priority Cu-Ni-PGE targets in the central area of the project to expand zones of mineralization adjacent to Inco Ltd.’s historical resource area (see Figure 1), as well as to test several geophysical anomalies that were generated through the recent modelling of airborne geophysical data provided through the Ontario Geological Survey’s data set, GDS 1235.</p><p>“This announcement represents a significant milestone for the W2 project. Additionally, PTX is encouraged to be able to demonstrate the ability to work at the project area to further evaluate its potential,” said Greg Ferron, President and CEO of PTX Metals Inc. “The groundwork for this program involved consolidating the project and includes all historical resource areas. This process included analyzing the historical 74 diamond drill holes that had been drilled in the central area.</p><p> “PTX worked with the local communities from planning through to execution of the program and benefited from their valuable insights and contribution.”</p><p>Drilling is primarily focused to the northeast of a compiled 7.5 km long trend of Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization and the aim is to expand the strike length of the mineralization in areas that have seen little to no drilling by previous operators.</p><p><strong><u>Modelling of Historical Resources:</u></strong></p><p>PTX is modelling the historical data which now includes the claims acquired in January 2024, and will design drill targets within this area to be followed up with a Phase 2 drill program that will be used by PTX towards producing a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate. </p><p>The current drill program was designed and approved before the acquisition of the claims within the central area of W2 (see Figure 1) as announced in January 2024, this added significant value to our shareholders and the project. A historical non-compliant resource estimate<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> was reported on these claims by Inco, who had drilled 47 holes with an average depth of 129 m and estimated the area contained approximately 14.6 million tons averaging 0.58% copper and 0.37% nickel. Limited assaying for cobalt, gold, platinum, and palladium were completed at the time<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The historical resource area is mainly composed of mafic to ultramafic intrusive rocks that are associated with EM anomalies. They are also in proximity to lithological contact between mafic volcanics/metasedimentary rocks and mafic-ultramafic intrusive rocks which is interpreted to be an important factor for controlling higher grade Cu-Ni mineralization. Building on Inco’s work, KWG completed an additional 20 diamond drill holes within the central area of W2. Subsequently, Aurora Platinum (“AP”) drilled another 14 diamond drill holes within the Central Area (Figure 1) and primarily focused on expanding the Project to the northeast of Inco’s historical resource estimate. AP completed 3,831 m in 14 drill holes to a maximum length of 274 m and reported several widespread zones of Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization up to 220 m in length.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/><p><a href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">[1]</a> The resource estimate is a historical estimate as defined by National Instrument 43-101. There has been no review of the methods and results of this historical resource estimate by a Qualified Person.

Field observations and bulk rock chemical data from samples collected at the Axe Lake claim block in September 2023 have revealed anomalous levels of rare metals (Rb, Cs, Ta, Nb) and lithium. Although historical government mapping indicated favourable geology in the area, this exploration program was the first time to target rare metals and represents the confirmation of rare metal values in the Axe Lake Deformation Zone (“ALDZ”) in the Muskrat Dam Lake greenstone belt. The Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project is held by Green Canada Corporation (GCC), in which Platinex has majority equity ownership.</p><p>The Muskrat Dam Project is located in Northwestern Ontario, approximately 125 km northeast of Frontier Lithium’s PAK lithium project and 125 km northwest of Newmont’s Musselwhite gold mine.</p><p>Highlights of the discovery include:</p><ul><li>chemically evolved, tourmaline-muscovite granitic pegmatite dyke swarm exposed over a</li><li>minimum 0.5 by 2.2 km area on the Severn River</li><li>beryl-type pegmatites with anomalous Rubidium (Rb) (845 ppm), Cesium (Cs) (42 ppm), Tantalum (Ta) (158 ppm), Niobium Nb (64 ppm), and Lithium (Li) (141 ppm)</li><li>highest Tantalum 158 ppm or 225 times its mean upper continental crust value</li><li>40% of Nb/Ta ratios are below 2.0, signifying extreme fractionation</li><li>pegmatite distribution controlled by Axe Lake Deformation Zone (ALDZ), a major ductile transcurrent fault system with 30 km inferred strike length on property</li><li>similar deep crustal fault zones host rare metal pegmatite systems elsewhere, such as the Pakeagama Lake lithium pegmatite group in the Bearhead Lake deformation zone</li><li>similarity of tectonic setting and lithochemistry to the Red Sucker Lake lithium pegmatite group, 160 km northwest in Manitoba, ostensibly in the same regional fault system</li></ul><p>“The Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project was originally staked for its copper/nickel prospectivity, but the comprehensive work by Dr. Breaks and Mr. Osmani on the Axe Lake Deformation Zone has added a significant new aspect to the project,” says Greg Ferron, President and CEO, Platinex Inc.</p><p>“Tantalum is not easily found in economic concentrations, so these very early indications are particularly interesting as they shine a light on the Axe Lake Deformation Zone and the structural control of the mineralization in a major fault system,” says Dr. Fred Breaks, Geological Advisor, “Of interest, is the ratio of niobium to tantalum which suggests that tantalum was being concentrated compared to niobium. The significance of the other rare metals found in these grab samples serve as indicators to the tantalum, which in today’s world, has the higher value.” The field examination of the 6,175-hectare Axe Lake claim block occurred from September 4-10, 2023, and included collecting 62 grab samples in two confined areas of the large claim block (see Figure 1). The work focused on an initial evaluation of lithium and related rare metals (Cs, Rb, Ga, Nb, and Ta). Also, it examined specific interelement magmatic indicator ratios as a function of granitic pegmatite rock type.<br></p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/02/14151415/image.png" alt="Image" /></figure><p>The ALDZ represents part of a significant regional fault zone system that extends at least 70 km northwest into the Sachigo-Ponask lakes area and into Manitoba, where lithium pegmatite mineralization (petalite) occurs at Red Sucker Lake. Deep crustal fault systems importantly represent S-type peraluminous pegmatitic granite generation sites via anatexis of clastic metasedimentary protoliths and as conduits for the emplacement of resulting fractionated granitic pegmatitic melts to higher crustal levels. Many rare metal pegmatite groups in the Superior Province of northwestern Ontario occur within major ductile deformation zones, most notably in the Bearhead Lake deformation zone (“BLDZ”), 160 km southwest of Axe Lake, where Frontier Lithium<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> has established resources of 26 mt (M&amp;I) of 1.62% Li<sub>2</sub>O and 32.4 mt (Inferred) 1.41% Li<sub>2</sub>O. Complex-type, petalite-subtype pegmatites are now known over a 54 km strike length of the BLDZ with the recent discovery by Blaze Minerals Ltd.<a></a><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p><p>The Axe Lake pegmatite group also compares with the 0.5 by 14 km Red Sucker Lake, Manitoba pegmatite group, situated 155 km northwest, which contains a petalite pegmatite zone with a range of 0.57 to 1.48% Li<sub>2</sub>O.<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> The pegmatitic groups in both areas show a significant overlap of data fields in the Nb <em>vs. </em>Ta and Cs <em>vs. </em>Rb diagrams, further supporting a similar fertile granite system at Axe Lake along the same regional fault system. Possible fertile parent granite bodies may exist in the batholithic areas immediately northeast of the ALDZ in the Severn River area adjacent to the greenstone belt boundary.</p><p>The Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project was selected as part of the Ontario Junior Exploration Program (OJEP). Under OJEP, the Company will receive a grant covering 50 percent of qualifying exploration expenses accrued at the project between April 1, 2023, and February 15, 2024, with a maximum grant amount of \$200,000. OJEP is an initiative of the Government of Ontario that aims to attract investment in early exploration, expand the pipeline of mineral development projects, including critical minerals, and lead to more mines and jobs in Ontario.<strong><u></u></strong></p><p><strong><u>About Tantalum<br></u></strong>Tantalum is resistant to corrosion, superconductive, and incredibly hard. It is important for modern technology as it is used in electronic circuits and capacitors, as well as semi-conductors, superalloys (Jet Engines), and medical implants.<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> In 2023, the price of tantalum was approximately USD\$190/kg. The demand for Tantalum is forecast to grow at CAGR of 5.26%.</p><p><strong><u>QA/QC</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p><p>Analytical work was undertaken by ALS Global utilizing the complete characterization package CCP-PKG-05.

(CSE: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) </strong>(“<strong>Platinex</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”) is pleased to announce results from its mechanized stripping and channel sampling program at the Ronda claims located in the central area of the district scale Shining Tree Gold Property, Ontario. The Shining Tree Property is held through the South Timmins Mining Joint Venture (“South Timmins JV”) with Fancamp Exploration Limited.<a> </a></p><p>The program is the first significant work program since Platinex acquired the Ronda surface claims from Alamos Gold in 2022 and has confirmed the high-grade nature of the Ribble structure at surface. The surface claims are directly above the historical underground workings owned by Platinex. The Ronda mine was a small-scale historical producer with two shafts and underground workings and produced 2,727 oz. gold and 4,830 oz. silver from 22,309 tonnes of ore during its one-year mine life (1939-1940).<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p><p>The program reported significant gold grades over broad widths with highlights from composite channel samples including:</p><ul><li>Channel N30 assayed 9.04 g/t Au over 16.15 m, including 60.30 g/t Au over 1.00 m</li><li>Channel N33 assayed 4.54 g/t Au over 13 m, including 8.88 g/t Au over 1.05 m</li><li>Channel N36 assayed 5.63 g/t Au over 7.95 m, including 11.50 g/t Au over 0.90 m</li><li>Channel N31 assayed 7.97 g/t Au over 4.95 m, including 14.50 g/t Au over 0.65 m</li><li>Channel N38 assayed 4.49 g/t Au over 8.05 m, including 11.30 g/t Au over 1.95 m</li></ul><p>“Exploration at Shining Tree/Ronda was previously constrained by not having the surface rights. The mineralization appears to be continuous across much of the exposed face of the vein and immediate wall rock, and the returned gold and silver grades are consistent with historical grades reported from the Ronda Mine, thereby strengthening confidence that significant additional gold and silver mineralization exists on the Ronda claims,” says Greg Ferron, President, and CEO of Platinex Inc.</p><p>Individual samples highlights include:</p><ul><li>Sample 504509 assayed 60.30 g/t Au over 1.00 m</li><li>Sample 504508 assayed 25.70 g/t Au over 1.05 m</li><li>Sample 504657 assayed 15.50 g/t Au over 0.70 m</li><li>Sample 504594 assayed 11.30 g/t Au over 1.95 m</li></ul><p>Mineralized widths were reported with a 0.3 g/t Au cutoff, and a maximum allowable interval of 3 meters below a 0.3 g/t Au cutoff grade within a reported channel sample interval. Intervals are reported as composites of the sampled lengths and are not true widths. Individual samples within the composite channel sample intervals averaged 0.87 meters.  </p><p>The Ribble vein and immediately surrounding wall rock is structurally more complex than previously described or understood in the historical literature.</p><p>See the Company’s website for a complete table of composites, channel sample results and additional maps.</p><p>Gold grades at Ronda, are associated with generally steeply dipping, variably folded, east-northeasterly trending quartz veins, which are oriented highly oblique to the northerly trending, 65 degrees west dipping structural zone (Ribble Zone) that hosts the veins.  Channel sampling was conducted perpendicular to those veins and is therefore roughly parallel to the host structure.  At Ronda, historical mining was conducted to about 205 m depth across widths of 2 to 3 meters, which includes an uncertain amount of hanging and footwall dilution. The average dip of the mined Ribble structure was 65 degrees to the west. This is consistent with mapping of the veining at surface, occurring within a zone having an apparent width of 3 to 4 meters in the North trench, and a much narrower and more sporadic zone of veining in the south trench.</p><p>Future work will investigate the potential across strike, in the hanging and footwall, for additional mineralized structures.  Limited historic drilling may have not adequately tested that potential, as holes were drilled perpendicular to the Ribble structure and therefore roughly parallel to the mineralized veins.</p><p>Ronda North Trench Overview:</p><ul><li>A total of 1,912 m<sup>2</sup> were mechanically stripped, washed, and channel sampled.</li><li>A total of 150 individual channel samples were cut with lengths that ranged from 0.30 m to 1.70 m and averaged 0.94 m.</li><li>81 channel samples exceeded 1 g/t Au, including 33 channel samples over 5.00 g/t Au and 14 channel samples exceeding 10 g/t Au.</li><li>Results ranged from 0.01 g/t to 60.30 g/t Au, and &lt;0.30 g/t to 51.40 g/t Ag with a high sample value of 60.30 g/t Au.</li></ul><p>Figure 1: Ronda North Trench</p><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com\\/media\\/2024\\/02\\/07152336\\/Ronda-North-Trench-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2313&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;object-fit:cover&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:&quot;cover&quot;,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Ronda North Trench 1&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Ronda North Trench 1&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image" class="wp-block-image size-full wp-lightbox-container"><img data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/02/07152336/Ronda-North-Trench-1.jpg" alt="Ronda North Trench 1" style="object-fit:cover"/><button

The shear zone is part of a suite of secondary conjugate faults that are related to the east-trending Ridout-Tyrrell Deformation Zone.</p><p>The shear zone within the stripped areas is strongly schistose with variable amounts of pervasive iron-enriched hydrothermal alteration along with sets of s-folded quartz veins that reflect episodes of brittle-ductile fracturing and quartz infilling to or oblique to the schistosity during progressive left-handed shearing.  The north-trending, west-to-southwest dipping Ribble vein is exposed on moderately to steeply west-facing slopes in both stripped areas (as a sheet-like body).  At the Ronda North stripped area, the eastern half of the exposed outcrop has been eroded below the level of the projected “up-plunge” extension of the vein system.  The exposed Ribble vein has been interpreted as tightly buckle-folded discontinuous portions of a once continuous quartz vein with the fold hinges and limbs moderately plunging to the south-southwest.     </p><p>Channel samples were typically orientated perpendicular to the schistosity and the limbs of folded quartz veins along the dip-slope of the vein system. </p><p><strong><u>QA/QC Program</u></strong></p><p>Channel samples were cut using a diamond blade saw, inserted into labelled bags, and delivered by representatives of Platinex to Activation Laboratories Ltd. in North Bay, Ontario. Activation Laboratories Ltd. is an ISO 17025:2005 accredited testing laboratory.</p><p>Samples were analyzed by fire assay using the 1A2 package with a gravimetric finish (1A3 package) for samples that returned greater than 5,000 ppb Au.  Multi-element analysis was completed by near-total digestion (four-acid) with an ICP-OES finish (IF2 package).

        content: `<p><strong>Toronto, Ontario, January 17, 2024</strong> – Platinex Inc. (CSE: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) ( “Platinex” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the successful acquisition of a major claim package which contains a historical resource within the existing Central Area boundary of Platinex’s 100% owned W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE Project (“W2”) located in the “Ring of Fire” region of Northern Ontario. The acquisition includes 19 single cell mining claims from Gungnir Resources Inc. (“Gungnir”) as well, Platinex acquired 13 adjacent claims to complete the consolidation of the W2 project area.</p><p>“This acquisition gives the Company full control of W2 including all of the historical resource area. This not only improves the project’s economic potential, but also enables us to execute a complete exploration program along the 7.5 km mineralization zone which shows potential for expansion at depth and along strike,” says Greg Ferron, President and CEO of Platinex.</p><p>The 32 newly acquired claims total 630 hectares (6.3 km2) and include 42 out of 73 historical drillholes drilled within the Central Area of W2 (see Figure 1). A large portion of the historically identified mineralization zones lay on these newly acquired claims. This includes the following drill hole intersections completed by previous owners:</p><ul><li>Hole 54002 intersected 0.92% Cu, 0.73% Ni over 18.2 m</li><li>Hole 54004 intersected 0.48% Cu, 0.15% Ni over 32.0 m</li></ul><p>Most of the historical drillholes are shallow (less than 150 m) with potential open at depth.</p><p>The new claim areas are mainly composed of mafic to ultramafic intrusive rocks that are associated with EM anomalies. They are also in proximity to lithological contact between mafic volcanics/metasedimentary rocks and mafic-ultramafic intrusive rocks which is interpreted to be an important factor for controlling higher grade Cu-Ni mineralization.</p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2024/01/17064438/image002-1024x792.jpg" alt="Image002" /></figure><p>Figure 1: W2 Project New Claims</p><p><strong>Terms of the Transaction:</strong></p><p>Platinex has paid C\$30,000 and issued 3,000,000 Platinex shares to Gungnir. The Platinex shares were issued at a deemed price of \$0.05 and are subject to the standard 4-month and a day hold period. Platinex has also granted Gungnir a 2% net smelter returns royalty on the 19 claims (the “Royalty Interest”), which the Company may repurchase 1% for C\$500,000.</p><p>W2 is permitted for a Phase 1 exploration program with mineral exploration permits in place for up to 31 drill pads across the property. Additional desktop work, including further compilation of greenfield areas, and modelling of airborne geophysical data is ongoing, and the Company is finalizing plans for its 2024 exploration program at W2.</p><p>Previous operators identified numerous mineralized zones within a 7.5 km long folded corridor. Inco described the central area as containing a potential resource of “approximately 14.6 million tons averaging 0.58% copper and 0.37% nickel with minor values in cobalt, gold, platinum and palladium” based upon 47 drillholes.

(“BAW”) on its 100% owned W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE project located in a region of world-class geological targets near Northern Ontario’s Ring of Fire.</p><p>In total, 71 holes totalling 12,157 metres drilled by historical operators (Aurora Platinum, Canadian Nickel/INCO, and KWG Resources) were compiled into digital format. BAW completed one geological model, one moderate-grade mineralization model (calculated as copper equivalent (CuEq)<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> grades over 0.3%) and one high-grade mineralization model with CuEq over 0.8% based on the compiled data.</p><p>Key findings of the modelling program include:</p><ul><li>Moderate-grade mineralization is extensive (over 6 km strike length) in the central area of the W2 project with mineralized zones open to depth and in all directions.</li><li>Multiple zones of high-grade mineralization with over 0.8% CuEq were identified.</li><li>High grade zones occur in the gabbroic unit and seem closely spatially associated with the lithological contacts between mafic volcanics/metasedimentary rocks and mafic to ultramafic intrusive rocks.</li><li>Historical drillholes intersected wide intersections of mineralization in the central area of the property; for example, LH01-06 intersected 220.6m of 0.54% CuEq and LH01-05 intersected 151.6m of 0.56% CuEq.</li><li>Strong correlation is observed between Cu-Ni mineralization and electromagnetic (EM) anomalies in the central area of the project. In addition, numerous EM anomalies, which have not been explored, are located across the project. Greenfield targets remain to be tested in the north, west and east of the property.</li><li>Titanium vanadium targets in the northwest area near hole LH01-10 remain to be further explored.</li></ul><p>Drill target areas have been designed and were categorized into three categories (confirmation, expansion, greenfield). Further exploration programs, such as gravity, EM, and induced polarization (IP) geophysical surveys as well as more data compilation on the W2 project are being planned to refine certain drilling targets on top of the 3D modelling.</p><p>Please visit the W2 project page on Platinex’s website at <a href="https://ptxmetals.com/projects/w2-copper-nickel-pge/">https://ptxmetals.com/projects/w2-copper-nickel-pge/</a> for a presentation on W2 including modelling results and other project information.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Shuda Zhou, P. Geo. (W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE Project) who is a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects for the W2 Project.</p><p>About the W2 Project:</p><p>W2 is a district scale land package comprised of 1,122 cell units covering 22,094 ha (220 km2) in an area of world-class geological targets located in the Oxford Stull Dome Complex near Ontario’s Ring of Fire. W2 controls the mineral-rich and under-explored, layered mafic-ultramafic Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (“LHIC”), which is highly prospective for copper-nickel (Cu-Ni), platinum group element (PGE), gold and chromite deposits. The common thread of strong Cu-Ni-PGE, Cr and Ti-V mineralization in the mafic- ultramafic intrusions ringing the Oxford Stull Dome is suggestive of a common source, a very large magmatic system, and therefore a potential significant abundance of metals in each intrusion.</p><p>Historical work, including approximately 20,000 metres of drilling in the W2 area by operators such as INCO and Aurora Platinum, has been delineated at least seven significant mineralized zones within a 7.5 km long folded corridor near the centre of the land package. Additionally, VTEM and AeroTEM II airborne geophysical surveys have identified multiple high-priority conductors in the eastern section of the property which have yet to be drill tested.</p><p>About Platinex Inc.</p><p>Platinex Inc. creates shareholder value through the opportunistic acquisition and advancement of high-quality projects in prolific Canadian mining camps. Current assets include a 100% ownership interest in the W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE Project near the “Ring of Fire” in northern Ontario and a 75% interest in the South Timmins Mining joint venture with Fancamp Exploration, which is focused on gold exploration along the Ridout-Tyrell Deformation Zone near IAMGOLD’s Côté Gold operation in the southwest Abitibi. Platinex also holds majority ownership in Green Canada Corporation, which holds uranium assets in Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec, as well as an option to earn as a 100% ownership interest in the Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project in northwestern Ontario. In addition to its mineral exploration assets, Platinex holds a portfolio of net smelter return (NSR) royalties on gold, PGE, and base metal properties in Ontario. Having put together a strong and diversified project portfolio and an expert technical team, the Company is focused on comprehensively exploring and evaluating each project to maximize shareholder value.

The program will consist of five drill holes for a maximum total of 950 metres following up on the greenfield gold discovery announced on November 9, 2023, that was generated through B-horizon soil geochemical surveys, prospecting, and a mechanized stripping/channel sampling program.</p><p>The Heenan Property lies within the Swayze area of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt in Northwestern Ontario. The Property is located on the fold nose of the Woman River magnetic high indicating a structural target favourable for gold which formed the basis for the exploration program (see Figure 1). The Heenan Mallard Gold Project is located immediately adjacent to Northern Superior’s October Gold Property, which was recently optioned by Evolution Mining Ltd. and is also northwest of IAMGOLD Corp.’s Côté Gold Project.</p><p>The drill holes will target mineralization identified in Trench 1 and Trench 2 as well as test several high-priority Spectral IP anomalies that coincide with a northwest-orientated structure known as the Mallard Shear Zone.</p><p>The Mallard Shear Zone is a regional structure with associated gold mineralization along it and it has been interpreted as a splay structure off of the main Ridout Deformation Zone. This structure could provide conduits for hydrothermal fluids to deposit gold mineralization along favourable horizons within the Archean stratigraphy.</p><p>Recent work by Platinex discovered gold mineralization associated with narrow concordant felsic to intermediate dykes and iron formation within the metavolcanic sequence. In Trench 2, strong silicification and sulphide mineralization within a felsic to intermediate dyke at the contact with iron formation returned a composite weighted average of 4.05 g/t Au over 2.00 m, with 2.39 g/t Au over 8.00 m being returned from the adjacent iron formation (see news release dated Nov 9, 2023).</p><figure><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2023/11/16165955/Figure-1-1024x791.jpg" alt="Figure 1" /></figure><p>Figure 1: Heenan Property Geology</p><p><strong><u>Shining Tree Gold Project – Ronda Mine</u></strong>:</p><p>Platinex is also pleased to announce completion of a substantial program at Shining Tree with assays expected in January 2024.

The Strata Lake formation occurs within the upper portions of the Marion Group which is thought to correlate with the Deloro assemblage of the southern Abitibi belt, based on U-Pb geochronology (van Breemen, et.al, 2006). Van Breemen, et.al., describe the upper portions of the Strata Lake formation as “dominated by variably chloritized and sulphidized volcanic rocks related to crackle breccia zones that are interpreted to represent paleo-hydrothermal conduits for iron-rich fluids that precipitated out of the overlying ironstones”.</p><p>The iron formation located at the west end of the Property appears to have been displaced at a possible fold nose for a distance of approximately 1.1 km by a dextral strike-slip fault, informally termed the Mallard Shear zone, a regional structure which is part of several northwest–southeast directed fault structures that may have provided conduits for hydrothermal fluids to deposit mineralization at favorable horizons within the stratigraphy, particularly at the contact of the felsic volcanic rocks with the iron formations (Flanagan, 2018).</p><p>Project History:</p><p>The Property was acquired by Fancamp Exploration Ltd. in 2018 and greenfield exploration work including soil sampling, prospecting, and geophysics (Spectral IP) was carried out during the period from 2018-2020.

Geological mapping and channel sampling are underway in preparation to drill test a high-priority coincident geophysical (IP) and geochemical anomaly. Follow-up prospecting and infill geochemical sampling (B-horizon) is also planned for Mallard.</p><p><strong><u>Mallard Gold Project Results:</u></strong></p><p>During the month of August, field crews completed reconnaissance prospecting and geochemical programs in the Woman River area (Camp and River Zones). The primary objective was to identify potential extensions of the Camp and River Zones, previously explored by Noranda Exploration Co. Ltd. These zones targeted gold mineralization hosted within two northwest-oriented shear zones that are interpreted as splays of the Ridout Deformation Zone which is located south of the Property.</p><p>Historical diamond drill intercepts at Camp and River (41O09NW0003) include:</p><ul><li>5.04 g/t Au over 3.69 m (BE-85-1)</li><li>6.62 g/t Au over 1.83 m (BE-85-3)</li><li>1.85 g/t Au over 6.25 m (BE-85-4)</li><li>3.50 g/t Au over 2.77 m (BE-85-5)</li><li>5.31 g/t Au over 3.84 m (BE-85-6)</li></ul><p>A total of 446 B-horizon soil samples were collected to cover the projected strike of the historical zones where limited historical work has been completed.

The most significant area lies approximately 500 m southeast of the Camp Zone and is defined by a cluster of samples that range from 54 ppb to 1,210 ppb Au and may be related to the mineralization hosted within the same structure or parallel structures that hosts the Camp Zone. (Figure 1)</p><p>A total of 32 grab samples were also collected and submitted for analysis. Values of the samples ranged from below detection (&lt;5 ppb) to 1,520 ppb Au (1.52 g/t), with 6 samples returning &gt; 100 ppb Au. The most significant results come from an area 500 m east-southeast from the Camp Zone where an infilled historical trench was discovered through prospecting. The material in the trench and surrounding area consisted of pyrite-bearing quartz-carbonate veinlets hosted within felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks with values ranging from below detection (&lt;5 ppb) to 983 ppb Au. Of the 8 samples collected from this area, 2 of the samples returned &gt; 500 ppb Au.

Previous drilling in the central area had identified a 7.5 km folded corridor with widespread Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization. </li><li>South Timmins Gold Joint Venture exploration activities are underway as planned with work commenced at the Heenan Gold Project.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project</u></strong><strong></strong></p><p>ALS Goldspot, under the guidance of Platinex’s Technical Advisors Dr. Fred Breaks, P.Geo. and Ike Osmani, P.Geo., have recently completed initial fieldwork at the Axe Lake property, included in the Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project. The objective of the exploration program is to locate and sample white granitic pegmatites identified in historical mapping and test them for lithium and other rare metals mineralization.</p><p>An initial 66 rock samples were collected, and reconnaissance geological mapping was carried out by the ALS Goldspot team to guide future exploration programs. During the field visit, several potassic pegmatites with yellow muscovite, tourmaline, and garnet were observed and sampled. Assay results are pending.</p><p>Additional work on the project will include a VTEM airborne geophysical survey planned to commence during the 2023-2024 winter season, which will cover sections of the 12,934 ha (129 km<sup>2</sup>) project located within the Muskrat Dam greenstone belt where historical operators had drilled intersections of attractive grades of copper, nickel, and gold.</p><p>Significantly, the Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project was selected as part of the Ontario Junior Exploration Program (OJEP). Under OJEP, the Company will receive a grant covering 50 percent of qualifying exploration expenses accrued at the project between April 1, 2023, and February 15, 2024, with a maximum grant amount of \$200,000. OJEP is an initiative of the Government of Ontario that aims to attract investment in early exploration, expand the pipeline of mineral development projects, including critical minerals, and lead to more mines and jobs in Ontario.</p><p>“Exploration is the first and most vital part of the made-in-Ontario supply chain we are building for critical minerals,” said George Pirie, Minister of Mines. “It is the intrepid junior exploration companies like Platinex that will find the mines of the future that will bring critical minerals to the world and prosperity to northern and Indigenous communities across Ontario.”</p><p>Greg Ferron, President and CEO of Platinex, said “Platinex appreciates the Ontario government’s recognition of the value in developing mineral exploration skills and assets. We are pleased to be included as beneficiaries of this latest round of OJEP funding. Platinex is aligned with the Ontario government’s economic objectives to pursue the opportunities inherent in the province’s natural resources.”</p><p><strong><u>W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE Project</u></strong></p><p>Platinex has engaged BAW Mining Inc. to conduct a data compilation and 3D modeling program to generate a geological and mineralization model for the W2 project. The program will incorporate all drill holes completed within the project’s boundaries as well as GIS data collected from past operators to provide a greater understanding of the controls and extent of the Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization at the project.</p><p>The review will focus on 63 diamond drill holes totaling over 12,000 m completed at W2 and the central area of the project. Previous drilling in the central area identified a 7.5 km folded corridor with widespread Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization. </p><p>BAW Mining’s analysis is expected to be completed in October. Their results will be used to refine targeting for infill and expansion drilling for the next drill program.</p><p>The W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE Project covers 22,094 ha (220 km<sup>2</sup>) in an area of world-class geological targets controlling a significant part of the “Oxford Stull Dome Complex”, including the mineral-rich and under-explored, layered mafic-ultramafic Lansdowne House Igneous Complex, which is highly prospective for copper-nickel (Cu-Ni), platinum group element (PGE), and chromite deposits.</p><p><strong><u>South Timmins Mining JV Properties</u></strong></p><p>Since completing the South Timmins Mining Joint Venture and commencing exploration activities earlier this year (see press release dated August 1, 2023, for program overview) the Company has completed 2,233 B-horizon soil samples and collected 134 rock samples at the <strong>Shining Tree Gold Project</strong>.</p><p>The program includes Platinex’s first exploration work at the Ronda mine located in the central area of the property. Work has been completed in Areas 2 and 3 and is ongoing in the central area. In addition, reconnaissance prospecting has been carried out in Area 1 along the Rideout Deformation Zone.</p><p>In August, field crews conducted extensive exploration activities including prospecting, geochemical surveying, and geological mapping at both the Camp and River zones of the <strong>Mallard Gold Project</strong>. The primary aim of this program was to identify potential extensions of these zones, which had previously been explored by Noranda and had revealed gold mineralization hosted within two northwest-oriented shear zones. In total, the team collected 32 rock samples and 446 B-Horizon soil samples, all of which have been submitted to Activation Laboratories Inc. for analysis.</p><p>A detailed update from work at the Shining Tree and Mallard Gold Projects will be released upon receipt of final assays which are expected later in September.</p><p>Currently, the Company has commenced stripping, channel sampling, and geological mapping work in preparation of drilling a high-priority coincident geophysical and geochemical anomaly at the Heenan Gold Project. Upon completion of the stripping program, a similar stripping program will be carried out at the formerly producing Ronda Mine at Shining Tree in September. </p><p><strong>Qualified Person</strong></p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P.

Following the completion of this program, the Company plans to conduct a diamond drilling program focused on Camp, River, and new targets generated in the area from the upcoming fieldwork.</p><p><strong><u>Shining Tree Gold Project:</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p><p>Work crews recommenced activity on July 24, 2023, and are currently advancing a comprehensive program at the Ronda/Central Area including Area 3 of the Shining Tree Gold Project. The central area hosts numerous gold occurrences and small historic producers, and past workers have largely focused on individual vein occurrences. The Joint Venture intends to assess the possible long-strike relationship between these occurrences, and the cross-strike potential, which has been largely ignored. The program includes prospecting, geochemical surveying, and geological mapping. Additionally, stripping and trenching in the Ronda area is planned to better understand the mineralization controls on the surface.</p><p>During the recent technical review, Ronda was identified as a priority area for further investigation, and this is the first work at Ronda since Platinex acquired the past producer. Within the Ribble structure, auriferous tension veins oblique to the strike of the structure are observed at surface and are an important gold host in the area where past mining occurred at Ronda. These veins have unknown strike extensions and would have been poorly tested in sparse historic drilling and present an excellent opportunity to define additional mineralization on the structure, especially considering the historical results from stripping and surface work completed by Haddington Resources Ltd. (41P11SE0035).</p><p>Exploration work is also planned in Area 1 which will include reconnaissance prospecting and geological mapping to target the RTDZ northwest of the Herrick area.</p><p>Work at Shining Tree’s Area 2 (projected 6 km strike length of the RTDZ) and Area 3 (identified by Windfall Geotek artificial intelligence) and confirmed with subsequent soil gas hydrocarbon and B-horizon soil sampling has been completed in July and results will be announced following the receipt of assays.</p><p><strong><u>Heenan Gold Project:</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p><p>The Heenan Gold Project, also located in the Swayze Greenstone belt, is located within the Woman River anticline and is centered on the Woman River iron formation. Previous work by Fancamp at Heenan returned coincident geochemical and grab samples values ranging from &lt;5 ppb to 1,000 ppb Au for B-horizon samples, and &lt;5 ppb to 422 ppb Au for grab samples associated with a northwest-orientated section of the Woman River iron formation.  The samples coincide with multi-line Spectral IP anomalies as well as structurally complex magnetic data over the area of interest.</p><p>A stripping program is planned to commence in September with drilling anticipated to follow upon the completion of the program.</p><p><strong><u>Follow-up:</u></strong></p><p>Data generated through the above work programs at Shining Tree, Heenan and Mallard will aid in the development of a comprehensive geological model for the South Timmins Mining properties. Following the successful completion of these work programs the Joint Venture intends to select the highest priority targets for drilling. The Joint Venture also plans to continue advancing its green fields target portfolio over this period.</p><p>About the South Timmins Mining Joint Venture:</p><p>South Timmins Mining is a joint venture with Fancamp, in which Platinex holds a 75% interest and Fancamp holds a 25% interest (see news release dated March 15, 2023).

(CSE: PTX) (OTCQB: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) </strong>(“<strong>Platinex</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”) is pleased to provide an update on its exploration activities and corporate developments.</p><p><strong><u>W2 Copper-Nickel PGE and Gold Project (“W2”)</u></strong></p><p>At W2, located near Ontario’s Ring of Fire, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, <strong>Endurance Elements Inc.</strong> (“Endurance Elements”), has received exploration permits, from Ontario’s Ministry of Mines for twelve (12) drill pads in the western and central area of the project. The permits are dated June 14<sup>th</sup>, 2023, and remain valid for three (3) years. Permits for nineteen (19) drill pads in the eastern portion of W2 were issued in October and December 2022. Endurance Elements is now authorized to proceed with a Phase 1 exploration program.</p><p>Greg Ferron, President, and CEO of Platinex, stated: “Since taking ownership of the project in January 2022, Platinex/Endurance Elements has been actively engaging with local indigenous communities and Ontario&#8217;s Ministry of Mines (MINES) and remains committed to strengthening these relationships as exploration activities proceed. The issuance of these permits is a valuable step, and we can now proceed to begin work to prove the significant Cu-Ni-PGE potential of the project.”<br><br></p><p>The W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE and Gold Project is comprised of 1,122 cell units covering 22,094 ha (220 km<sup>2</sup>) in an area of world-class geological targets near Ontario’s Ring of Fire.

        content: `<p>Toronto, Ontario, May 17, 2023 – <strong>Platinex Inc. (CSE:PTX) (OTC: PANXF, Frankfurt: 9PX) </strong>(&#8220;<strong>Platinex</strong>&#8221; or the &#8220;<strong>Company</strong>&#8220;) is pleased to provide an update on its Shining Tree Gold Property in which the Company holds a 75% interest through the South Timmins Mining joint venture (“South Timmins”) with Fancamp Exploration Ltd. (see news release dated March 15, 2023). South Timmins holds a 100% interest in the Shining Tree Gold Property which borders Aris Gold’s Juby Property as well as a 100% interest in the Heenan Mallard Gold Project which borders IAMGOLD’s Côté Gold Project.</p><p>At Shining Tree, the joint venture is working to identify new gold targets in several highly prospective and underexplored areas of the 225 km<sup>2</sup> land package including along the Ridout- Tyrrell Deformation Zone (RTDZ) while continuing more focused exploration efforts in the central area of the project to support additional drilling at the Herrick deposit, Caswell prospect, and historic Ronda Mine (see attached map).</p><p>Field crews have mobilized to begin follow-up work on new gold targets which have been identified through generative work during 2022; work is commencing in Area 3.</p><p>Concurrently, ALS Goldspot Discoveries, a geoscience AI and data laboratory, has concluded their property-wide data compilation. The results are being used by the Company to finalize exploration and drilling programs for 2023.</p><p>Further information regarding the exploration activities and drill programs for Shining Tree and Heenan Mallard will be provided in a separate press release once the plans are finalized.</p><p>The 2023 exploration programs at Shining Tree and Heenan Mallard are being led by Joerg Kleinboeck, P.Geo., a professional geoscientist with 24 years of experience in mineral exploration. Notably, he brings extensive years of experience working in the Shining Tree area, and he previously held a role managing exploration programs at Heenan Mallard.</p><p><strong>Geochemical Results</strong></p><p>During the fall of 2022, Platinex completed reconnaissance geochemical and prospecting programs over three areas (2, 3 and 5, see map) that were identified as being highly prospective and underexplored for gold mineralization (see news release dated December 7, 2022). Results for 1,905 B-horizon soil samples from areas 2, 3 and 5 submitted to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (“Actlabs”) have identified several areas that warrant further prospecting, infill geochemical sampling, and geophysical surveys to define potential drill targets. The most notable targets are located in Area 2 and Area 3.</p><p>In Area 3, several anomalous B-horizon soil samples were returned that coincide with the previously announced high-priority SGH (Soil Gas Hydrocarbon) anomaly, referred to as the Bob Lake Anomaly, which was described by Actlabs as having a ‘high probability that gold</p><p>mineralization may be present’. The most significant soil sample was 269913 which returned 683 ppb Au and is located at the centre of the Bob Lake Anomaly. Additional infill soil sampling has been proposed over this target, followed by line cutting and geophysics (induced polarization and magnetometer surveys) to advance the target toward drilling.</p><p>Area 2 targets a projected 6 km strike length of the RTDZ (“Ridout-Tyrrell Deformation Zone”) that has seen very little historical exploration. Reconnaissance work by Platinex in 2021 and 2022 has led to several highly anomalous B-horizon soil samples and till samples “down-ice” of the interpreted structure where soil samples returned gold values up to 380 ppb, and till samples returned up to 43 pristine gold grains, indicating a possible nearby bedrock source for the gold.

        content: `<p>Toronto, Ontario, April 18, 2023 – <strong>Platinex Inc.</strong> <strong>(CSE:PTX)</strong> <strong>(Frankfurt: 9PX)</strong> (&#8220;<strong>Platinex</strong>&#8221; or the &#8220;<strong>Company</strong>&#8220;) is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Endurance Elements Inc. (“Endurance Elements”) has expanded its W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE and Gold Project (the “W2 Project” or “W2”) near Ontario’s Ring of Fire by acquiring 225 additional single-cell mining claims. The total land package at W2 now comprises 1,122 cell units covering 22,094 ha (220 km<sup>2</sup>). Notably, Barrick Gold has recently taken on a large land position in the immediate W2 area, staking 1,198 single-cell mining claims covering 23,565 hectares (235.65 square km<sup>2</sup>) of ground adjacent to blocks held by Endurance Elements (see claim map in Figure 1).</p><p>Since the acquisition of W2 in January 2022 – primarily for its historically drilled Cu-Ni-PGE mineralized zones, the Company has strategically expanded the western edge of the project within the Lavoie Lake Shear Zone System towards Northern Superior Resources’ gold-focused TPK project. Through multiple acquisitions and the addition of claims by staking, Endurance Elements has more than doubled its total land package at W2. The latest claims were staked by Springer Mineral Resources (“Springer”) in 2022 and 2023 and, per prior agreement, were recently transferred to Endurance Elements at the cost of staking. Certain of the claims are subject to a 0.5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty in favour of Springer.</p><p>The Lavoie Lake Shear Zone System, which has over 35 km strike length through W2, is interpreted as a series of splay shears/faults off the Stull-Wunnummin Fault Zone (SWFZ), a major transcrustal regional structure. The SWFZ extends easterly for over 600 km from Gods Lake in Manitoba through Big Trout Lake and the W2 property to the Ring of Fire area in Ontario. Historical high-grade gold values reported from the W2 property are 9.3 g/t Au and 23.8g/t Au in grab samples from the Sandvik and Goose showings, respectively.</p><p>Exploration plans for W2 remain focused on expanding the historical Cu-Ni-PGE zone at the centre of the property and testing Eagle’s Nest-style VTEM targets in the eastern portion of the project. However, the western expansion of W2 represents a significant addition to W2 and brings compelling gold opportunities and optionality to the project.</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P.

The “Swayze magnetic anomaly” shows signs of hydrothermal alteration, which, combined with the associated gold mineralization at Heenan Mallard, makes the property a very attractive gold target.</p><p>Drilling returned several high-grade near-surface intercepts, including 5.04 g/t Au over 3.69 m core length (BE-85-1), 5.31 g/t Au over 3.82 m core length (BE-85-6), 3.50 g/t Au over 2.80 m core length and 6.62 g/t Au over 1.82 m core length (BE-85-3).</p><p>Prospecting, geological mapping, soil sampling, and geophysical surveys carried out by Fancamp at Heenan Mallard in 2019-2020 have generated multiple targets in other sections of the project. Of these, the two most highest priority gold targets identified currently for follow up drilling are an undrilled gold showing at Heenan that is coincident with an IP anomaly and an undrilled zone along the Ridout shear at Mallard with a coincident soil and IP anomalies.</p><p>There are other gold zones on the property, including an area previously drilled by Fancamp to be revisited since it has returned anomalous gold values up to 6.32 g/t hosted by strongly altered metasedimentary rocks (Ciesielski 2021, Assessment File 20000019548). This area presents a broad zone of strong pervasive silicification and quartz veining.</p><p><strong>Dorothy Project:</strong></p><p>The Dorothy property is a grassroots project that was staked to cover four anomalous lake sediment anomalies reported in 2006 OGS&#8217;s high-density Lake sediment survey. The property appears to be situated on a parallel geological structure 15 km east of the Manitou Straits deformation zone&#8217;s, which hosts the historical Gold Rock Mining Camp and borders Dynasty&#8217;s Thundercloud gold discovery.</p><p>*Gold values and core lengths are converted from imperial unit troy ounce/t and core lengths in feet to metric units g/t and metre, respectively.</p><p>Advisors</p><p>The Company engaged Canaccord Genuity to assist as an advisory of the transaction and the Offering.</p><p>Other Transaction details:</p><ul><li>Fancamp will be granted anti-dilution rights to participate in future Platinex equity financings to purchase up to its proportionate share of such Shares for terms at least as <a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/favorable" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">favorable</a> to Fancamp as <a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/the-price" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">to price</a> and upon the terms provided to other subscribers in such financings</li><li>In addition, Fancamp has agreed to vote for management or withhold from voting while the Option is effective</li><li>Fancamp is also restricted from acquiring more than 9.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Platinex (excluding the exercise of warrants held by Fancamp)</li></ul><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P.

        content: `<p><strong>TORONTO, January 16, 2023 &#8211; Platinex Inc. </strong>(CSE: PTX) (Frankfurt 9PX) <strong>(“Platinex” </strong>or the <strong>“Company”) </strong>is pleased to announce additional information about its recently acquired Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project (the “Muskrat Dam Project” or the “Project”) including the appointment of members of an advisory committee to assist the Company with the development of the Project. With additional staking in December 2022, Platinex’s Muskrat Dam Property now totals 12,934 hectares (129 km<sup>2</sup>) which includes the 7,025 hectare (70 km<sup>2</sup>) Axe Lake property, which shows the potential to host lithium-bearing pegmatites and will be the focus of initial exploration activity at the Project.</p><p>The Muskrat Dam Project is located in Northwestern Ontario approximately 125 km northeast of Frontier Lithium’s PAK lithium project and 125 km northwest of Newmont’s Musselwhite gold mine. The Project comprises six (6) property blocks in the highly prospective Muskrat Dam Lake (MDGB) and Rottenfish River (RRGB) greenstone belts (see Figures 1 and 2), where multiple groups have recently staked claims.</p><p>Platinex is pleased to have Dr. Fred Breaks join the Company as a technical advisor. A noted expert on lithium, he discovered the two largest lithium-rich rare-element deposits (Li-Ta-Rb-Cs) in Ontario: Separation Rapids Pegmatite of Avalon Advanced Materials Corp. and Pakeagama Lake Pegmatite of Frontier Lithium. In addition, Mr. Ike Osmani, a technical advisor to the Company on the Shining Tree and W2 programs, will also provide technical assistance on the Muskrat Dam Project. Both Dr. Breaks and Mr. Osmani are experts in the geology of Northwestern Ontario and have knowledge of the Muskrat Dam Project area through previous work at the Ontario Geological Survey and research reports covering the MDGB and adjacent North Caribou and Sandy Lake greenstone belts. Combined with Jim Trusler’s previous lithium experience including work for Teck Corporation and privately a mineral valuation, and later acquisition, of the Georgia Lake lithium deposit, their involvement will benefit Platinex’s exploration activities at the project.</p><p>Project Geology</p><p>A newly recognized major high-strain zone, the northwest-trending Axe Lake deformation zone (ALDZ), as termed here, is interpreted to pass through the Axe Lake and Munekun Lake properties (Figure 1). This major, regionally extensive structural zone potentially provided pathways for granitic melts and evolving pegmatites, potentially lithium-bearing and other rare metals, to be emplaced into volcano-sedimentary rocks on the Axe Lake property. The Muskrat Dam project also contains compelling copper-nickel- platinum group elements (Cu-Ni-PGE), gold, and chromite targets. Inco, Canadian Occidental, Serem, and other operators carried out historical exploration in the area during the 1970s and 1980s. However, the belt has seen little modern exploration, providing an excellent opportunity to make potential discoveries.</p><p>The Muskrat Dam Lake (MDGB) and Rottenfish River (RRGB) are Meso- to Neo-Archean (2.9-2.7 billion year old) greenstone belts that occur in the core Sachigo Terrane in the northwestern part of the Superior Geological Province. The southeastern part of the MDGB may connect with the North Caribou</p><p>Lake greenstone belt, which hosts the Musselwhite Gold Mine. The MDGB and RRGB typically comprise volcano-sedimentary rock sequences. They are internally intruded by felsic and mafic to ultramafic sills, stocks, and dikes and bounded by external composite granitic batholiths (Figure 1).</p><p>These belts are deformed by an early D1 thrusting event causing the repetition of volcanic sequences from differing stratigraphic positions. The subsequent D2 deformation caused the D2 fold-parallel shears to separate the various volcano-sedimentary assemblages. The emplacement of the large batholiths surrounding the belt broadly warps the D2 fold axes within the belt. Several major northeast and northwest-striking fault/shear zones transect the MDGB and RRGB. From an economic point of view, the north-northeast-striking Windigo River Shear Zone (WRSZ) and northwest-trending, Axe Lake Deformation Zone (ALDZ) occur respectively near/along the east-central and northwest margins of the MDGB. These structures are potential hosts to gold and copper mineralization. The ALDZ is hosting potentially lithium-bearing white pegmatites on the Axe Lake property.</p><p><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2023/04/16170132/2023-01-16_NR-Fig1.jpg"><br>Figure 1: Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project geological map Axe Lake Property</p><p>The Axe Lake property is situated at the north-central edge of the Muskrat Dam Lake greenstone belt along the contact with the Misquamaebin Lake batholith (MLGB), which is composed of many discrete composite plutons (Figure 2). Volcano-sedimentary rocks underlie the property, which is bounded on the</p><p>northeast by the MLGB. The northwest-trending, regional Axe Lake deformation zone (ALDZ) passes through the property. The property hosts numerous white granitic pegmatites of potential lithium and rare metals mineralization. ALDZ potentially provided pathways for granitic melts and evolving pegmatites to be emplaced into volcano-sedimentary rocks on the property. Ayers (1969) describes the white pegmatites as dikes, sills, and lenses that commonly occur between Axe Lake and the Morrison River. These pegmatites typically consist of albite-oligoclase, quartz, muscovite, tourmaline, garnet, magnetite, and molybdenite. According to Ayers, the pegmatites have a maximum crystal size of 15 centimetres, and one of the pegmatite dikes, on a small island in the Severn River at the entrance of Axe Lake, contains fractured black tourmaline crystals up to 10 cm long.</p><p>The white muscovite-bearing pegmatites have also been intersected in a historic drill hole (#43455-0) located in the southeastern part of the property. These pegmatites occur within highly schistose and brecciated graywacke and gabbroic rocks.</p><p>Ayers also reported the presence of equigranular, garnetiferous, potassic muscovite-bearing postgabbro leucogranites and pegmatites elsewhere in the MDGB. The presence of these rocks along with white muscovite-bearing pegmatites indicates that the Muskrat Dam project presents a favourable environment for the presence of potential lithium-bearing pegmatites. According to Lewis and Paterson (2020), the geological setting of these rocks at the Muskrat Dam project is comparable with Frontier Lithium&#8217;s PAK lithium project which is situated near an intersection of three differing lithologies, mafic to intermediate metavolcanic muscovite-bearing granitic and metasedimentary rocks.</p><p><img src="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2023/04/16170120/2023-01-16_NR-Fig2.jpg"><br>Figure 2: Axe Lake Property geological map Windigo ‘A’ Property</p><p>The Windigo ‘A’ property is mainly underlain by massive to pillowed mafic flows and minor felsic to intermediate tuffs and sedimentary rocks. Narrow dikes, sill-like bodies of gabbro, and feldspar±quartz porphyries have been emplaced concordant to volcano-sedimentary sequences. The north-to-northeast- trending WRSZ passes through and deforms all rock types. Gold is associated with pyrite-chalcopyrite in quartz vein lenses within sheared gabbro sills and volcano-sedimentary rocks. Historic grab sampling from a gossonous trench located within two 3rd-party held interior cell claims reportedly yielded up to 4.06 oz/t Au and 2% Cu (Murdy 1984, Assessment File #53G05SW0004 2.6245). Historical drilling by Canadian Occidental (1984) and Eldor Resources (1984-85) on the interior claims adjacent and north and south of the trenched area intersected visible gold (KP-2-84) and multiple anomalous gold intercepts (e.g., 0.186 oz/t over 2.4m &#8211; KP-4-84, 0.425 oz/t over 1.3m &#8211; KP-14-84, 0.128 oz/t over 3.0m &#8211; KP-85-21, and 0.480 oz/t over 0.3m &#8211; KP-85-21).</p><p>Fox Bay Property</p><p>A part of an extensive east-west-trending Fox Bay mafic-ultramafic sill (FBMS) underlies the property. The FBMS comprises crudely differentiated gabbro to diorite, anorthositic gabbro, and serpentinized peridotite. The sill has the potential to host Cu-Ni-PGE and chromium deposits. However, since it is highly underexplored, the economic potential needs to be thoroughly evaluated by modern geological, geochemical, and geophysical exploration methods. In the early 1970s, Canadian Onex and Serem Ltd drilled a few core holes on and adjacent to the property. MDL-7, drilled by Canadian Onex, intersected serpentinized peridotite for 124 m of its total core length. Serpentinite contains traces of disseminated, fine-grained sulphides (mostly pentlandite and pyrite) that, from several core samples, yielded anomalous nickel (up to 0.4%) and copper (up to 0.10%). The property has not been explored since the mid-seventies.</p><p>Technical Advisor Biographies</p><p>Dr. Fred Breaks joins the Company as a technical advisor on the Muskrat Dam project. Dr. Breaks is an independent geological consultant. He received his Ph.D. in geology from Carleton University and spent 29 years at the Ontario Geological Survey.

        content: `<p><strong>TorONTO, December 29, 2022 &#8211; Platinex Inc. </strong>(CSE: PTX) (Frankfurt 9PX) <strong>(“Platinex” </strong>or the<strong> “Company”) </strong>is pleased to announce that it has closed the previously announced option agreement through which it has the right to acquire a 100% interest in the Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project (the “Muskrat Dam Project” or the “Project”) (<strong>see press release dated December 14, 2022, for further details</strong>).</p><p>The Muskrat Dam Project is located in Northwestern Ontario, approximately 125 km northeast of Frontier Lithium’s PAK lithium project and 125 km northwest of Newmont’s Musselwhite gold mine. The Project comprises 671 unpatented mining claims over six (6) property blocks, which together cover approximately 12,925 hectares (129.25 km<sup>2</sup>) in the highly prospective Muskrat Dam Lake (MDGB) and Rottenfish (RGB) greenstone belts. The Project includes the Axe Lake Property, which shows the potential to host lithium-bearing pegmatites. A major high-strain zone, the northwest-trending “Axe Lake deformation zone” (ALDZ), as termed here, is interpreted to pass through the property. This major structural zone potentially provided pathways for granitic melts and evolving pegmatites, potentially lithium-and other rare metals-bearing, to be emplaced into volcano-sedimentary rocks on the property. Additional information regarding the Project, work program, and the technical advisors assisting the Company with the Project will be provided early in the new year.</p><p><strong><u>Additional Transactions</u></strong></p><p>The company also recently completed two additional transactions.</p><p>At Shining Tree, the Company acquired a 100% interest in two (2) claims in Leonard township. The claims lie within Target Area #5, which is host to potential splay structures similar to the Tyrrell Fault hosting the Juby and other gold deposits in adjacent Tyrrell Township. The area is characterized by a magnetic high coincident with the folded iron formation and is considered a favourable setting for gold deposits. One hundred fifty thousand (150,000) common shares of Platinex have been issued to an arm’s length party as consideration for the claims. The shares are subject to a statutory 4-month hold period.</p><p>The Company’s district-scale 225 km<sup>2</sup> Shining Tree Gold Project is located in the Abitibi region of Ontario, a world-renowned gold district. The Shining Tree Gold Project covers a significant portion of the Ridout-Tyrrell deformation zone that trends as far west as Newmont’s Borden Mine, through the area of IAMGOLD’s Cote Gold Deposit, and across Aris Gold’s Juby Project. The Company has a 100% interest in the Shining Tree Gold Project.</p><p>At the W2 Copper Nickel PGE Project, the Company closed an option agreement with two (2) arm’s length parties, through which it has the right to acquire a 100% interest in fifty-two (52) unpatented mining claims. The claims are within the boundary of the Company’s existing land package. The Company paid \$5,000 and issued 500,000 common shares on closing. The shares are subject to a statutory 4-month hold period. To earn its 100% interest, the Company must make additional payments totaling \$35,000 over the three-year term of the option agreement. Upon exercising the option, the vendors will retain a 1.5% NSR royalty on the claims. Platinex has the right to repurchase a 0.5% NSR royalty at any time for \$500,000, leaving a total 1.0% NSR royalty on the claims.</p><p>The W2 Project is a district-scale land package comprising 836 unpatented mining claims (897 cell units) and covering approximately 17,665 hectares (176.6 km<sup>2</sup>) at the southwestern extent of Ontario’s Ring of Fire. W2 controls one of the major Oxford Stull Dome complexes, including the layered mafic-ultramafic Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (&#8220;LHIC&#8221;), which is highly prospective for copper-nickel (Cu-Ni), platinum group element (PGE), and chromite deposits. Historical drilling by Inco and Aurora Platinum defined a 7.5 km folded corridor near the centre of the land package where widespread near-surface Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization was identified in widely spaced holes that returned mineralized intercepts of up to 220 m.</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P. Geo, a qualified person for exploration at the Muskrat Dam, Shining Tree, and W2 Projects, as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p><strong>About Platinex Inc.: </strong>Platinex creates shareholder value through the opportunistic acquisition and advancement of high-quality projects in prolific Ontario mining camps.

The Muskrat Dam Project is located in Northwestern Ontario approximately 125 km northeast of Frontier Lithium’s PAK lithium project and 125 km northwest of Newmont’s Musselwhite gold mine. The Project comprises six (6) property blocks, which together cover 10,950 hectares (109.5 km<sup>2</sup>) in the highly prospective Muskrat Dam Lake (MDGB) and Rottenfish (RGB) greenstone belts (see Figures 1 and 2).</p><p><a href="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2023/04/16170133/2022-12-14_NR-Fig1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"></a><br>Figure 1: Northwestern Ontario Mines and Prospects</p><p>The Project includes the Axe Lake Property, which shows potential to host lithium-bearing pegmatites. A major high-strain zone, the northwest-trending “Axe Lake deformation zone” (ALDZ), as termed here, is interpreted to pass through the property. This major structural zone potentially provided pathways for granitic melts and evolving pegmatites, potentially lithium-and other rare metals-bearing, to be emplaced into volcano-sedimentary rocks on the property. The Muskrat Dam Project also contains compelling Cu-Ni-PGE, gold, and chromite targets. Inco, Canadian Occidental, and other operators carried out historical exploration in the area during the 1970s and 1980s. However, the belt has seen little modern exploration, providing an excellent opportunity to make potential discoveries.</p><p>The acquisition positions Platinex as a significant player in this new area of interest as critical mineral exploration activity increases in Ontario. It also complements the Company’s more advanced W2 Cu-Ni-PGE project, which controls the Lansdowne House Igneous Complex, a prominent feature of the Oxford Stull Dome near Ontario’s Ring of Fire.</p><p><a href="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2023/04/16170133/2022-12-14_NR-Fig2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"></a><br>Figure 2: Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project geological map</p><p>Axe Lake Property</p><p>The Axe Lake Property comprises 321 cell claims covering 6,175 hectares. The property is situated at the north-central edge of the Muskrat Dam Lake greenstone belt along the contact with the Misquamaebin Lake batholith (MLGB), which is composed of many discrete composite plutons. Volcano-sedimentary rocks underlie the property, which is bounded on the northeast by the MLGB. Ayers (1969), who mapped the Muskrat Dam Lake greenstone belt, describes the white pegmatites as dikes, sills, and lenses that commonly occur between Axe Lake and the Morrison River.<sup>1</sup> These pegmatites typically consist of albite-oligoclase, quartz, muscovite, tourmaline, garnet, magnetite, and molybdenite. According to Ayers, the pegmatites have a maximum crystal size of 15 cm, and one of the pegmatite dikes, on a small island in the Severn River at the entrance of Axe Lake, contains fractured black tourmaline crystals up to 10 cm long.</p><p>The white muscovite-bearing pegmatites have also been intersected in a historical drill hole (#43455-0) located in the southeastern part of the property. These pegmatites occur within highly schistose and brecciated graywacke and gabbroic rocks.</p><p><a href="https://wp-platinex-2024.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/2023/04/16170133/2022-12-14_NR-Fig3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"></a><br>Figure 3: Axe Lake Property geological map</p><p>Ayers also reported the presence of equigranular, garnetiferous, potassic muscovite-bearing post-gabbro leucogranites and pegmatites elsewhere in the MDGB. The presence of these rocks along with white muscovite-bearing pegmatites indicates that the Muskrat Dam Project presents a favourable environment for the presence of potential lithium-bearing pegmatites. According to Lewis and Patterson (2020), the geological setting of these rocks at the Muskrat Dam Project is comparable to Frontier Lithium’s PAK lithium project which is situated near an intersection of three differing lithologies, mafic to intermediate metavolcanic muscovite-bearing granitic and metasedimentary rocks.<sup>2</sup></p><p>Other Properties</p><p>The Muskrat Dam Project includes the Windigo gold property, located at the southeast end of MDGB. At Windigo, Gold is associated with pyrite-chalcopyrite and occurs in quartz vein lenses within sheared north-south striking gabbroic sills. Gold has also been reported (Ayers 1969) on the Rottenfish property. Finally, the Fox Bay Property adds the optionality of a compelling Cu-Ni-PGE target. Fox Bay is underlain by mafic to ultramafic sills and has the potential to host Cu, Ni, PGE, and chromite mineralization.</p><p>Greg Ferron, CEO of Platinex, stated: “the acquisition of the Muskrat Dam Project fits well with our strategy of acquiring large-scale projects in significant greenstone belts in Ontario. This acquisition is being completed on attractive earn-in terms with a low up-front cost. Our initial focus will be to confirm the nature of mineralization at the Axe Lake Property and potential lithium grades through a prospecting and evaluation program.</p><p>Option Agreement Terms</p><p>The binding letter of intent provides for Platinex, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Endurance Elements, to acquire a 100% ownership interest in the Muskrat Dam Critical Minerals Project by way of an earn-in option agreement with an arm’s length party.</p><p>Pursuant to the Agreement, Platinex will pay the following consideration and work commitments:</p><p>Payments:</p><ul><li>C\$25,000 paid in cash on closing</li><li>C\$25,000 paid in shares within 60 days of closing</li><li>C\$25,000 paid in shares on the 1st anniversary</li><li>C\$75,000 paid in shares on the 2nd anniversary</li><li>C\$100,000 paid in shares on the 3rd anniversary</li></ul><p>Work expenditures:</p><ul><li>C\$100,000 spent by 1st anniversary</li><li>C\$100,000 spent by 2nd anniversary</li><li>C\$100,000 spent by 3rd anniversary</li></ul><p>Milestone Payments:</p><ul><li>C\$50,000 paid in cash upon completion of a successful prospecting and evaluation program confirming lithium grades exceeding 1%</li><li>C\$250,000 paid in cash or shares (min. \$75,000 in cash) upon completion of an NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate on the Muskrat Dam Project</li></ul><p>All share issuances will be based on the 5-day VWAP price at the time of issue and will be subject to a statutory 4 month hold period.</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P.

        content: `<p><strong>TorONTO, December 7, 2022 &#8211; Platinex Inc. </strong>(CSE: PTX) (Frankfurt: 9PX) <strong>(“Platinex” or the “Company”) </strong>is pleased to provide an update on exploration activities at its Shining Tree Gold Project (&#8220;Shining Tree&#8221; or the &#8220;Project&#8221;) located in the Abitibi region of Ontario, a world-renowned gold district.  </p><p>The Company has adopted a two-pronged approach whereby it is working both to identify new gold targets in several highly prospective and underexplored areas of the 225 km2 land package, including ground along the Ridout-Tyrrell Deformation Zone (RTDZ), through cost-effective grassroots prospecting methods, and to further develop drill targets at the centre of the property, including the Herrick deposit and the Ronda Mine area, through more advanced exploration. Several areas targeted as part of the current exploration program are on the grounds that Platinex acquired through recent property acquisitions.</p><p>Fieldwork carried out during 2022, including prospecting, geological mapping, litho-geochemical sampling, and soil sampling, as well as the compilation and modelling of historical drilling in the Herrick deposit and Ronda Mine areas, has increased Platinex’s understanding of the district-scale Shining Tree property and will assist in the development of exploration programs and prioritization of areas for stripping, trenching, and drilling as the Company advances the Project.</p><p>Recent field work</p><p>Soil sampling in new target areas 2 and 3 has been completed and target area 5 has been partially covered. 1,865 samples were collected and submitted to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (&#8220;Actlabs&#8221;) for Soil Gas Hydrocarbon (&#8220;SGH&#8221;) and/or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (“ICP-MS”) analysis. SGH results for area 3 have been received from Actlabs. </p><p>SGH results in area 3 identified a robust anomaly in one of the most reliable SGH Pathfinders Classes in predicting the presence of gold mineralization. The “Bob Lake Anomaly” (BLA), as termed here, is located immediately east of Bob Lake in the east-central part of the soil grid in area 3 (Figure 1). According to Actlabs, which has recommended the BLA target for drill testing, a rating of 5.0, based solely on SGH, means a high probability that mineralization may be present. The BLA corresponds with the potential gold mineralization targets identified by Windfall Geotek using artificial intelligence (AI) (see press release dated August 23, 2022). The BLA is a highly prospective target for further exploration including stripping, trenching, and drilling as the Company continues its work program at Shining Tree.  </p><p>A reconnaissance geological mapping transects along the highway in target area 1A identified a broad northeast-striking deformation zone with strong to intense iron carbonate alteration and quartz veining/stringers halfway between the Herrick and Ronda deposits. This deformation zone has a northeast trend similar to nearby historical gold-in-till anomalies. Detailed litho-structural mapping and lithogeochemical sampling will be completed to evaluate its economic potential for gold mineralization.</p><p>Target area 3: This target area, in south-central MacMurchy Township, was selected as a priority target following an AI review of historical data. The target area is cut by northwest and northeast-trending shears/faults and a north-northwest-trending fault similar to the Michiwakenda Lake Fault, which hosts the Herrick deposit located 400 m to the west in southeastern Churchill Township. Following the identification of the BLA, samples collected for SGH analysis will now be analyzed using ICP-MS and compared with SGH results to provide the Company with additional information on this target. A few outcrops along and immediately north of the east-west bush road were mapped and found to be deformed by northeast- to east-northeast-trending shear zones and altered to highly oxidized iron-carbonate+/-silica schist. These altered and deformed zone broadly correspond with a satellite SGH anomaly identified in the most north-central part of the soil grid (Figure 1).</p><p>Target area 2: This target area, in northern MacMurchy Township, covers the east-west-trending sheared Keewatin-Porcupine assemblage contact and is host to numerous northwest-trending splay structures off the RTDZ. The target area is coincident with significant gold-in-till anomalies. Soil samples have been collected and submitted to Actlabs for ICP-MS analysis.</p><p>Target area 5: This target area, in central Leonard Township, is host to potential splay structures off the RTDZ, similar to the Tyrrell Fault hosting the Juby and other gold deposits in adjacent Tyrrell Township. The target is characterized by a magnetic high coincident with the folded iron formation, which is considered a favourable setting for gold deposits. Field crews covered 65% of target area 5. Soil samples have been collected in the area covered and submitted to Actlabs for ICP-MS analysis.</p><p>Following receipt of ICP-MS results from targets areas 2, 3, and 5, as well as the ongoing project-wide data compilation, including the modelling of the Herrick deposit and the Ronda mine area, the Company will determine next steps in each target area, including potential litho-structural mapping, lithogeochemical sampling, geophysical surveying, stripping, trenching, and drilling. Additionally, the Company will continue soil sampling over the remaining portions of target area 5 as well as target areas 1A/B and 4 which have not been completed to date (see press release dated August 23, 2022).</p><p>Certain exploration expenditures incurred during recent work at Shining Tree qualifies for reimbursement through the Ontario Junior Exploration Program (see press release dated May 10, 2022).</p><p>Corporate Matters:</p><p>The Company has received inquiries from shareholders about the proposed share consolidation approved at Platinex&#8217;s annual general and special meeting of shareholders held on July 13, 2022. The Company wishes to inform shareholders that a share consolidation is not being completed at this time and, as stated in a press release dated August 27, 2022, the Company will not complete a share consolidation except as part of a shareholder value-enhancing transaction, such as a spin-off of assets.</p><p>QA/QC and Sampling Protocols</p><p>Soil samples were collected from the B-horizon of soil developed on a glacial till substrate.  Approximately 30 grams of material was collected from each sample site. For field duplicates, samples were taken from the same soil hole and were of approximately the same size and of the same representative sample medium. Following collection, samples were shipped to Actlabs in North Bay, Ontario for preparation. For SGH analysis, the samples are air-dried at 40°C, then sieved and the -80 mesh sieve fraction (&lt;177 microns) is collected. The collected “pulp” is packaged in a kraft paper envelope and transferred to Actlabs’ Organic Geochemical department in Ancaster, Ontario. Each sample is then extracted, compounds separated by gas chromatography and detected by mass spectrometry at a Reporting Limit of one part-per-trillion (ppt). The results of the SGH analysis are reported in raw data form in an Excel spreadsheet as “semi-quantitative” concentrations without any additional statistical modification.</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P.

        content: `<p><strong>TorONTO</strong><strong>, August 23, 2022 &#8211; Platinex Inc. </strong>(CSE: PTX) (Frankfurt: 9PX) <strong>(&#8220;Platinex&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) </strong>is pleased to provide an update on its 225 km2 Shining Tree Gold Project (&#8220;Shining Tree&#8221; or the &#8220;Project&#8221;) located in the Abitibi region of Ontario, a world-renowned gold district.  </p><p>The Company has commenced an exploration program designed to identify new gold targets in five areas located outside the central core of the property that are underexplored yet highly prospective. Prospecting, geological mapping, litho-geochemical sampling, and soil sampling will be carried out in each area (see attached image). The Company has also engaged a resource firm to compile historical data and model previous drilling in the central area and the recently acquired mine area (Ronda Mine). An exploration target review of the Herrick deposit will also be completed to identify potential expansion and infill drilling targets.</p><p>Exploration will also cover areas identified by Windfall Geotek Corp.’s (“Windfall”) artificial intelligence (“AI”) process. Windfall identified several new targets outside of areas of previous exploration activity (see attached image).  </p><p>Following the conclusion of current activities, the Company will analyze data from newly generated targets and the compilation and modelling of the central area of the Shining Tree property to determine the highest priority targets for further exploration and drilling activities later this year. The exploration plan includes stripping and trenching of the priority targets to generate high quality drill targets.</p><p><strong><u>New Target Generation and Location</u></strong></p><p>Several areas targeted as part of the current exploration program are on ground that Platinex acquired through recent property acquisitions from Treasury Metals Inc. (July 2020), Alamos Gold Inc. (August 2021), and Skead Holdings Limited (March 2022). These areas have not seen exploration activities by Platinex.</p><p><strong>Target Area #1</strong>: This target area located within Churchill Township covers several splay faults/shears off the Ridout-Tyrrell Fault Zone (“RTFZ”). Features of interest include potential iron formation within the Porcupine assemblage immediately Northwest of the Herrick Deposit along with the iron formation and the mylonitized, mineralized and deep-seated contact between the Keewatin-Porcupine assemblage in the Churchill and Corona gold occurrences area. Target #1 is characterized by a large magnetic high, with flanking lows, that is similar in size, and exhibits a similar magnetic gravity signature, to that found at the nearby Juby deposit.</p><p><strong>Target Area #2</strong>: This target area located in northern MacMurchy Township covers the east-west-trending sheared Keewatin-Porcupine assemblage contact and is host to numerous northwest-trending splay structures off the RTFZ. The target area is coincident with some significant gold-in-till anomalies.</p><p><strong>Target Area #3</strong>: This target area occurs in south-central MacMurchy Township.and was selected as a priority target by Windfall. The target area is cut by a north-northwest-trending fault like the Michiwakenda Lake Fault, parallel to and 400m east of the Herrick deposit in southeastern Churchill Township.</p><p><strong>Target Area #4</strong>: Asquith-Churchill Townships. Like Target Area #1, Target #4 is cut by northwest-trending splay faults/shears emanating from the RTFZ. The area is underlain by mafic to ultramafic flows and intrusive rocks as well felsic to intermediate porphyries. The target area is located on a deep seated, northwest-trending magnetic susceptibility high coincident with several historic gold showings and shafts.</p><p><strong>Target Area #5</strong>: The target area which occurs in central Leonard Township is host to potential splay structures similar to the Tyrrell Fault hosting the Juby and other gold deposits in adjacent Tyrrell Township. The target is characterized by a magnetic high coincident with folded iron formation and is considered a favourable setting for gold deposits.</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P. Geo, and Jim Trusler, P. Eng., both of whom are qualified persons for exploration at the Shining Tree Gold Project, as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p><strong>About Platinex Inc.: </strong>Platinex creates shareholder value through the opportunistic acquisition and advancement of high-quality projects in prolific Ontario mining camps. Current assets include a 100% ownership interest in the 160 km2 district scale W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE Project near the Ring of Fire and a 100% interest in the 225 km2 Shining Tree Gold Project in the Abitibi region of Ontario, a world-renowned gold district.

        content: `<p><strong>TORONTO, July 27, 2022 &#8211; Platinex Inc. </strong>(CSE: PTX) (Frankfurt: 9PX) <strong>(&#8220;Platinex&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) </strong>is pleased to provide an update on the W2 Copper-Nickel PGE (platinum group elements) project (&#8220;W2&#8221; or the &#8220;W2 Project&#8221;). The Company has recently completed go forward exploration plans at W2.</p><p>As part of the planning process, historical exploration and drilling data were analyzed, including 10,000 m of drilling by Aurora Platinum and Inco Limited, and airborne geophysical surveys by Aurora Platinum and Temex Resources. The Company has confirmed numerous drill targets, including step-outs within known areas of mineralization and new exploration targets in areas with no previous drilling. Dr. James Mungall, P. Geo., and Ike Osmani, P. Geo., advised management.</p><p><strong>Exploration plans at W2 include:</strong></p><ul><li>Infill drilling to establish the continuity of the historically-defined 7.5 km long widely-spaced Cu- Ni-PGE mineralization corridor in the central part of the western W2 land package. This program will include petrographic and preliminary bench-scale metallurgical studies on the disseminated sulfide mineralization;</li><li>Drill testing several high conductance-high magnetic susceptibility geophysical anomalies identified in a 2008 VTEM survey over the eastern portion of W2;</li><li>Carrying out a ground gravity survey over the ultramafic intrusion to detect potential chromite mineralization in the northeast part of the western W2 claims;</li><li>Conducting petrographic and or preliminary bench-scale metallurgical studies to justify additional drilling along strike of the Fe-Ti-V mineralization in the northwestern part of the W2 claims.</li></ul><p>At the centre of the property, a program of systematic step-out drilling will enable the Company to determine the continuity of mineralization and potentially expand historical resources as per the standards of NI 43-101. Currently, at least seven zones of significant Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization have been identified at wide spacing. For example, drill holes LH-01-05 and LH-01-06, which are located 4 km apart with no intervening drill holes, contain both wide sections of lower grade Copper Nickel Palladium Platinum mineralization and narrow sections of higher grade Cu-Ni-Pt-Pd mineralization. The historical drilling suggests a high level of continuity in the Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization.</p><p>Maxwell plate modelling of geophysical anomalies will be carried out to assist with selecting final drill hole locations and orientations.</p><p>Mineral exploration permit applications are ongoing in relation to the proposed work programs with drilling planned for the winter 2022/23 field season.</p><p><strong>W2 Project Summary</strong></p><p>The W2 Project is a district-scale land package comprising 784 mining claims (823 cells) and covering over 16,000 hectares (160 km2) at the southwestern extent of Ontario’s Ring of Fire. W2 controls one of</p><p>the major Oxford Stull Dome complexes, including the layered mafic-ultramafic Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (&#8220;LHIC&#8221;) which is highly prospective for copper-nickel (Cu-Ni), platinum group element (PGE), and chromite deposits. Historical drilling along a 7.5 km folded corridor near the centre of the land package has identified widespread Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization across the widely spaced holes.</p><p>Overall, the system shows strong parallels with the nearby Ring of Fire Intrusive Suite (ROFIS), with which it may well be coeval. At the LHIC, there is an ultramafic body within an area spanning 7 x 4 km, associated with a similar volume of gabbroic rocks, and there is a nearby ferrodioritic to ferrogabbroic intrusion hosting massive titano-magnetite layers.</p><p>The Company continues a program of community engagement and information-sharing with First Nation communities in the vicinity of the project.</p><p><strong>W2 Advisory Board and Management Appointment</strong></p><p>A W2 Advisory Board has been formed by the Company and appointment of a Director of Operations and Community Relations. The W2 Advisory Board will advise and assist management as the W2 project moves forward. Three professionals with substantial industry and project-related experience, including Dr. Mungall, and Mr. Osmani have been appointed to the advisory board.</p><p><strong>Dr James Mungall </strong>is an expert specializing in magmatic sulfide and chromite deposits and spent time as Chief Geologist for Noront Resources during the discovery and definition of their Ring of Fire deposit group. He received his BSc in Geology from the University of Waterloo and completed his MSc and PhD in igneous petrology at McGill University. He completed two years of postdoctoral research (in igneous petrology) at the Bayerisches Geoinstitut, followed by nearly three years of consulting in Quebec before joining the University of Toronto. He is now a Professor of Earth Sciences at Carleton University, where he teaches Mineral Deposits.</p><p><strong>Ike Osmani </strong>has 35 years&#8217; experience in field-based mineral exploration as well as resource development and research encompassing geological mapping, geophysical data interpretation, diamond drill program supervision, core logging, field project planning and supervision, and preparation of NI 43-101 technical reports as a Qualified Person (&#8220;QP&#8221;). Mr. Osmani was the Principal Consultant for Aurora Platinum, who oversaw exploration and drilling at what was then called the Lansdowne House Project, now W2, in the early 2000s.</p><p><strong>Mackenzie Potter </strong>holds extensive technical and managerial experience, having previously driven environmental, community relationships, and sustainability efforts for Treasury Metals, and has 10+ years of experience in northwestern Ontario securing meaningful dialogue with regional Indigenous communities. Mr. Potter currently holds a role at the Nuclear Waste Management Organization, advancing partnership dialogue in northwestern Ontario in support of the Adaptive Phased Management process and Canada&#8217;s plan for the long-term management of used nuclear fuel.</p><p>Additionally, Platinex has appointed Robin Webster as Director of Operations and Community Relations for the Company. The appointment expands his responsibilities from his current role managing the W2 Project. Robin has a strong track record in Northwestern Ontario in exploration and community development work and was previously the CEO of Goldeye Explorations Limited.</p><p>Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders</p><p>Platinex&#8217;s Annual General and Special Meeting (&#8220;AGSM&#8221;) of shareholders was held in Toronto, Ontario on July 13, 2022. At the AGSM, 65,222,477 shares were voted, representing 32.04% of the outstanding</p><p>shares and all resolutions passed with at least 99.47% approval. The following resolutions voted on an individual basis included appointing the following directors: Greg Ferron, James R. Trusler, Felix Lee, Christophe Vereecke, and Sam Kiri. The other resolutions included the appointment of auditors and share consolidation (up to 4:1). The Company contemplates completing the consolidation of shares only as part of a shareholder value-enhancing transaction.</p><p><strong>Capital Structure Changes</strong></p><p>The Company has granted 1,800,000 stock options to members of the new W2 technical advisory committee and three Consultants. The stock options shall be granted at a strike price of \$0.05 for a period of three (3) years with standard vesting provisions. In addition, the Company cancelled 3,300,000 outstanding stock options to former advisors and consultants of the Company. Further, the Company notes that 16,852,133 common share purchase warrants expired on July 15, 2022.</p><p><strong>Shining Tree Project</strong></p><p>The Company has commenced exploration activities at Shining Tree.

        content: `<p><strong>TORONTO, May 10, 2022 &#8211; Platinex Inc. </strong>(CSE: PTX) (Frankfurt 9PX) <strong>(“Platinex” or the “Company”) </strong>is pleased to announce that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Endurance Elements Inc. (“Endurance Elements”), has acquired additional mining claims adjacent to the W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE Project (the “W2 Project” or “W2”) in the Ring of Fire in Ontario, Canada. The new claims combined with the existing claims cover an 8-10 km long, northeast-trending magnetic high (the “Bartman Lake North Magnetic High” or “BNMH”) and include the area of a Titanium-Vanadium (Ti-V) discovery made by Aurora Platinum Corporation in 2001. See image.</p><p>The discovery drill hole LH01-10 bored in the BNMH intersected multiple intercepts of disseminated to massive titano-magnetite mineralization hosted within diorite-leucogabbro-anorthosite-gabbro- magnetite cumulate sequences. The three intercepts of semi-massive to massive titano-magnetite mineralization returned near economic grades of vanadium and titanium oxides (Mazur and Osmani 2002):</p><ul><li>0.34% V2O5 and 0.5% TiO2 over 13.5m (126.0m-139.5m)</li><li>0.4% V2O5 and 0.42% TiO2 over 6.0m (144.0m-150.0m)</li><li>0.081% V2O5 and 0.27% TiO2 over 3.0m (175.0m-178.0)</li></ul><p>These results were obtained from 19 core samples analyzed by the ICP partial acid-digestion method. When 8 randomly selected samples from all three intercepts were re-analyzed by the near-total digestion method to determine the true oxide values of these elements, all samples yielded significantly higher values (<strong>up to 8.2% TiO2 and 0.81% V2O5</strong>) than those determined earlier. These values are comparable to vanadium deposits mined at average grades ranging from 0.47% to 1.4% V2O5 in the Bushveld Complex (South Africa) and at the Windimurra Mine (Australia).</p><p>Importantly, while the lack of critical infrastructure in the Ring of Fire area currently represents a hurdle to the viability of such a Ti-V deposit, the region stands to be substantially improved as other projects in the area enter the development phase and the necessary infrastructure is built. In particular, the recent takeover of Noront Resources Ltd. by Wyloo Metals Pty Ltd. and recent announcements made by the Ontario/Federal governments are all positive developments for the area deposits and Company.</p><p>Platinex’s CEO, Greg Ferron, commented, “The Company’s near-term exploration plans at W2 will remain focused on expanding existing near-surface Copper-Nickel and Platinum-Palladium zones and testing several high-priority magnetic-high coincident EM conductors in the eastern section of W2, however, the Titanium-Vanadium deposit is a strategic asset that may prove to be of significant interest in the medium term.”</p><p>Platinex has issued 200,000 shares (the “Share Issuance”) as consideration for the acquisition and granted the seller a 2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty. The Company has the right at any time to</p><p>repurchase 50% of the NSR royalty for \$1,000,000. The Share Issuance is subject to a statutory 4-month hold period.</p><p>W2 Project Overview</p><p>The W2 Project is a district-scale land package comprising 784 mining claims (823 cells) and covering over 16,000 hectares (160 km2) at the southern extent of Ontario’s Ring of Fire. W2 controls one of the major Oxford Stull Dome complexes including the layered mafic-ultramafic Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (“LHIC”) which is highly prospective for copper-nickel (Cu-Ni) and platinum group element (PGE) deposits. The common thread of strong Cu-Ni-PGE, Cr and Ti-V mineralization in the mafic- ultramafic intrusions ringing the Oxford Stull Dome is suggestive of a common source, a very large magmatic system, and therefore a potential significant abundance of metals in each intrusion. At W2, widespread Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization has been delineated in at least seven significant mineralized zones within a 7.5 km long folded corridor near the centre of the land package. Additionally, VTEM and AeroTEM II airborne geophysical surveys have identified multiple high-priority conductors in the eastern section of the property which have yet to be drill tested.</p><p>Ontario Junior Exploration Program Grant</p><p>Platinex is also pleased to report that it has been approved for a grant through the Ontario Junior Exploration Program. The grant is for a maximum of \$80,000 and will be provided as a 50% rebate on expenditures related to prospecting, geochemical surveying, and reporting at the Company’s Shining Tree Project in Timmins during the summer of 2022 field season.</p><p>The Company will announce its Shining Tree gold exploration program in due course with funds from the OJEP grant being used for geological mapping and additional geochemical work, including a soil sampling program to follow up on the IP and gold-in-till work carried out in 2021. The results of these programs along with existing geophysical data (magnetic and IP) will be integrated to generate drill targets.</p><p>The technical information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P. Geo, a consulting geologist of the Company, and James R. Trusler, P.Eng., Chairman of Platinex Inc., and both are considered a qualified person for exploration at the W2 project, as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p><strong>About Platinex Inc.: </strong>Platinex creates shareholder value through the opportunistic acquisition and advancement of high-quality projects in prolific Ontario mining camps.

The additional 2,932 hectares (29.3 km<sup>2</sup>) of ground brings the W2 land package to 15,973 hectares (159.7 km<sup>2</sup>). Endurance Elements holds a 100% interest in the W2 Project.</p><p>The W2 Project now covers approximately 80% of the layered mafic-ultramafic Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (“LHIC”) which is highly prospective for copper-nickel (Cu-Ni) and reef-type platinum group element (PGE) deposits. The widespread Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization is delineated in at least seven significant mineralized zones within a 7.5 km long folded corridor. The common thread of strong Cu-Ni-PGE, Cr and Ti-V mineralization in the mafic ultramafic intrusions ringing the Oxford Stull Dome is suggestive of a common source, a very large magmatic system and therefore a potential significant abundance of the metals in each intrusion.</p><p>The new claims add 10 km of strike length to the project with W2 extending 35 km along the Lavoie Lake Shear Zone System and tying on to Northern Superior Resources Inc.’s TPK Project (25.87 g/t Au over 13.5 m) in the west. In addition, new claims in the northern section of W2 cover the strike extension of a known Fe-Ti-V oxide horizon.</p><p>Per the previously announced purchase and sale agreement between Endurance Elements Inc. and Springer Mineral Resources Corporation (“Springer”), certain of the 149 mining claims are Additional Properties and subject to a 0.5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty in favour of Springer.</p><p>The Company is currently compiling historic data and developing exploration plans for W2.

T-6 has a magnetic anomaly that is twice the size of the magnetic anomaly at the Eagle’s Nest deposit and the same mushroom shape with strong conductors in the cap.</p><p>T-7: Claims were staked along the northeastern and southwestern sides of the magnetic anomaly to cover potential mineralized extensions of the Cu-Ni-PGE target. T-7 is a magnetic anomaly with conductors located in a potential feeder dike of the Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (LHIC). T-5 and T-6 are also within the potential feeder dike zone.</p><p>T-8: Claims were added at T-8 to expand the area around several strong conductors near the southern end of a large magnetic anomaly associated with an intrusion. The conductors are of significant interest as their source could be Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization coming from the intrusion.</p><p>The new claims also increase coverage of the Lavoie Lake Shear Zone System (LSZS), which is a part of the regional transcrustal structure, the Stull-Wunnummin Fault Zone (SWFZ), and presents several shear- hosted gold targets on the W2 property. Several shear zone splays off the SWFZ host significant gold mineralization on Northern Superior’s TPK property (25.87 g/t Au over 13.5 m) located just west of the W2 property.</p><p>At least two long linear magnetic highs with EM conductors flanked by low magnetics extend from T-5 several km to the west and likely represent shear zones. These interpreted shear zones extend to T-11, a folded magnetic high, and represent prospective shear-hosted gold targets. Additionally, a northeast-</p><p>trending magnetic low extends southwesterly for approximately 9 km from T6 to the most southern property boundary and is interpreted to be a shear zone that also represents a prospective shear-hosted gold target. Finally, the magnetic lows in the south-central part of the magnetic anomaly near T-8 represent another prospective shear-hosted gold target.</p><p>Per the previously announced purchase and sale agreement between Endurance Elements Inc. and Springer Mineral Resources Corporation (“Springer”), the 198 mining are Additional Properties and subject to a 0.5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty in favour of Springer.</p><p>The Company has posted additional information on the new claims and additional information on the W2 Project in a presentation on its website (<a href="http://www.platinex.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">www.platinex.com</a>).</p><p>The information presented in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ike Osmani, P. Geo, a consulting geologist of the Company and James R. Trusler, P.Eng., Chairman of Platinex Inc. and both are considered a qualified person for exploration at the W2 project, as defined by National Instrument 43- 101, Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p><strong>About Platinex Inc.</strong></p><p>Platinex is listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol PTX. The goal of the company is to create shareholder value through the opportunistic acquisition, and discovery of strategically located projects in prolific Ontario mining camps.

        content: `<p><strong>TORONTO, January 17, 2022 &#8211; Platinex Inc. </strong>(CSE: PTX) (Frankfurt 9PX) <strong>(“Platinex” or the “Company”) </strong>is pleased to announce that it has closed the acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in the W2 Copper-Nickel-PGE Project (the “W2 Project” or “W2”). The W2 Project controls one of the major Oxford Stull Dome complexes (see image) and includes over 5 km of strike length of known Cu- Ni-PGE mineralization within a large (9,134 Hectare or 91 km<sup>2</sup>) land package located near the Ring of Fire. Historical exploration was carried out at W2 (formerly known as the Lansdowne House Property) by operators including Aurora Platinum Corp. during the 2000s, and Inco Limited, includes the following near surface drill results:</p><p>Holes assayed for Copper (Cu)-Nickel (Ni) only include:</p><ul><li>Hole 54017 in zone L-13 drilled <strong>61 m of 1.01% CuEq including 13.1 m of 2.06% CuEq</strong></li><li>Hole 49182 drilled <strong>20.91 m at 1.63% CuEq</strong></li></ul><p>These holes were located in Palladium and Platinum (PGE) areas would likely have a higher CuEq if assayed for PGEs.</p><p>Holes assayed for PGEs (with lower grade Cu-Ni) include:</p><ul><li>Hole LH-01-02 drilled <strong>42 m at 1.756 g/t PdEq</strong></li><li>Hole LH-01-06 intersected <strong>81.3 m at 1.196 g/t PdEq</strong></li><li>Hole LH-01-05 intersected <strong>17 m of 1.86 g/t PdEq</strong></li></ul><p>Two wider intersections include:</p><ul><li>Hole LH-01-06 intersected <strong>220.6 m at 0.56% CuEq or 0.956 g/t PdEq</strong></li><li>Hole LH-01-05 intersected <strong>151.6 m of 0.57% CuEq or 0.971 g/t PdEq</strong></li></ul><p>As noted, LH-01-05 contains a 151.6 m mineralized zone which appears to correlate with the mineralization in hole LH-01-06 (220.6 metres). The two holes are 4 km apart with no intervening drill holes. The apparent correlation of widely spaced holes suggests a high level of continuity in the Cu-Ni- PGE mineralization. LH-01-06 is also close to a Cu-Ni deposit on a small claim package enclosed by the W2 property and appears to be a continuation of that mineralization (see footnote1).</p><p>The W2 Project covers 70% of the layered mafic-ultramafic Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (“LHIC”) which is highly prospective for copper-nickel (Cu-Ni) and reef-type platinum group element (PGE) deposits. The widespread Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization is delineated in at least seven significant mineralized zones within a 7.5 km long folded corridor. The common thread of strong Cu-Ni-PGE, Cr and Ti-V mineralization in the mafic ultramafic intrusions ringing the Oxford Stull Dome is suggestive</p><p>of a common source, a very large magmatic system and therefore a potential significant abundance of the metals in each intrusion.</p><p>Greg Ferron, Interim CEO of Platinex, stated: “The acquisition of W2 was completed on attractive terms to enhance shareholder value. The W2 Project has tremendous exploration potential and will experience revaluation both through additional exploration and discoveries and from improving access and infrastructure in the region. The acquisition also complements Platinex’s Net Smelter Royalty portfolio in which the Company holds numerous royalties located in Ontario mining camps.</p><p>I would also like to welcome Robin Webster to the Platinex team. Robin has a strong track record in NW Ontario in exploration and community development work and was previously the CEO of Goldeye Explorations Limited. Robin will continue to manage the W2 Project.”</p><p>Immediate next steps at the W2 Project include compilation and review of historic exploration data, engagement with local First Nations, and exploration permits.</p><p><strong><u>Transaction Terms:</u></strong></p><p>The transaction has been effected by way of a purchase and sale agreement (the “Agreement”) between Platinex’s wholly owned subsidiary, Endurance Elements Inc. (“Endurance Elements”), and Springer Mineral Resources Corporation (“Springer”).</p><p>Pursuant to the Agreement, Platinex issued 3,625,000 Platinex shares to Springer (the “Share Issuance”). The Share Issuance is subject to a statutory 4 month hold period. Platinex has also paid C\$25,000 in cash and granted Springer a net smelter returns royalty of up to two (2%) on the mining claims comprising the W2 Project. An additional C\$25,000 cash payment will be made within 90 days of closing.</p><p>Subject to certain conditions and two shareholder value enhancing project milestones being achieved Platinex will pay up to an additional C\$300,000 to Springer, up to \$212,500 of which can be paid through the issuance of Platinex Shares such issuance of shares being based on the 5-day VWAP of Platinex shares immediately preceding the date of payment.</p><p><strong><u>Additional W2 Project Information and Regional Potential:</u></strong></p><ul><li>425 mining claims (464 cells) covering 9,134 Hectares (91 km<sup>2</sup>)</li><li>Approximately \$5M in historic exploration expenditures including 8,772 metres of drilling</li><li>Helicopter-borne electromagnetic and magnetometer surveys carried out by Aurora Platinum Corp. (VTEM, 2006) and Temex Resources Corp. (AeroTEM II, 2008). Numerous attractive targets require further evaluation and drill testing</li><li>Early drilling efforts assayed for PGEs sparingly. Assaying for anticipated PGE accessories such as rhodium, osmium, iridium and ruthenium has not been completed. This may represent an opportunity to enhance the value of the known mineralization</li><li>The Oxford Stull Dome hosts several large-scale, Cu-Ni PGE rich intrusive complexes including:<ul><li>Lansdowne House Igneous Complex (LHIC)</li><li>the Big Trout Lake Layered Intrusive Complex (wherein Platinex owns a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty), and</li><li>the Ring of Fire Intrusive Complex</li></ul></li><li>The W2 Project is transected by a major transcrustal structure, the Stull-Wunnummin Fault Zone (SWFZ), which extends easterly for 600+ km from Gods Lake in Manitoba through Big Trout Lake-LHIC to the Ring of Fire in Ontario and hosts several gold deposits/prospects including Yamana Gold’s Monument Bay/Twin Lakes Deposit in Manitoba and Northern Superior’s TPK gold prospect (25.87 g/t Au over 13.5 m), located just west of W2</li><li>Platinex’s technical team has significant Cu-Ni-PGE expertise including James Trusler, P.Eng. (Teck, Falconbridge), Blaine Webster, P.Geo. (Inco, Goldeye), Ike Osmani, P.Geo. (North American Palladium, Aurora Platinum). Ike is a highly accomplished geologist with significant expertise on magmatic Cu-Ni-PGE deposits gained through work as the Principal Consultant who led Aurora Platinum’s exploration and drill programs at W2 and has other related experience with Implats Canada’s Lac des Iles Mine and the Seagull Ultramafic intrusion in the Nipigon area.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Drill Assay Table, Footnotes and Qualified Person Disclosure:</u></strong></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Drill Hole</strong></td><td><strong>Zone</strong></td><td><strong>From<br>(m)</strong></td><td><strong>To<br>(m)</strong></td><td><strong>Width<br>(m)<sup>2</sup></strong></td><td><strong>Cu<br>(%)</strong></td><td><strong>Ni<br>(%)</strong></td><td><strong>Pd ppb</strong></td><td><strong>Pt ppb</strong></td><td><strong>CuEq<br>(%)<sup>3</sup></strong></td><td><strong>PdEq<br>g/t<sup>4</sup></strong></td><td><strong>Au ppb</strong></td><td><strong>Co ppm</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>LH-01-06<sup>1</sup></strong></td><td>L-11N</td><td>134.2</td><td>354.8</td><td><strong>220.6</strong></td><td>0.13</td><td>0.09</td><td>208</td><td>99</td><td><strong>0.56</strong></td><td><strong>0.956</strong></td><td>13.2</td><td>110.7</td></tr><tr><td>including</td><td> </td><td>134.2</td><td>215.5</td><td><strong>81.3</strong></td><td>0.15</td><td>0.12</td><td>281</td><td>143</td><td><strong>0.70</strong></td><td><strong>1.196</strong></td><td>13.5</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>including</td><td> </td><td>315.8</td><td>354.8</td><td><strong>39</strong></td><td>0.23</td><td>0.14</td><td>188</td><td>59</td><td><strong>0.79</strong></td><td><strong>1.360</strong></td><td>13</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td><strong>54017</strong></td><td>L-13</td><td>38.57</td><td>99.57</td><td><strong>61</strong></td><td>0.39</td><td>0.29</td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td><td><strong>1.01</strong></td><td><strong>1.731</strong></td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td></tr><tr><td>including</td><td> </td><td>48.54</td><td>61.66</td><td><strong>13.1</strong></td><td>0.99</td><td>0.5</td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td><td><strong>2.06</strong></td><td><strong>3.529</strong></td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>LH-01-05<sup>1</sup></strong></td><td>K-13</td><td>65.9</td><td>217.5</td><td><strong>151.6</strong></td><td>0.12</td><td>0.1</td><td>209</td><td>78</td><td><strong>0.57</strong></td><td><strong>0.971</strong></td><td>29</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>including</td><td>K-13</td><td>172</td><td>189</td><td><strong>17</strong></td><td>0.28</td><td>0.2</td><td>385</td><td>128</td><td><strong>1.08</strong></td><td><strong>1.860</strong></td><td>51.2</td><td>176</td></tr><tr><td><strong>49182</strong></td><td>K-13</td><td>25.9</td><td>46.8</td><td><strong>20.9</strong></td><td>0.56</td><td>0.5</td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td><td><strong>1.63</strong></td><td><strong>2.795</strong></td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>LH-01-02<sup>1</sup></strong></td><td>L-13</td><td>90</td><td>132.6</td><td><strong>42</strong></td><td>0.31</td><td>0.21</td><td>164</td><td>87</td><td><strong>1.02</strong></td><td><strong>1.756</strong></td><td>70</td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>including</td><td> </td><td>128.1</td><td>132.6</td><td><strong>4.5</strong></td><td>0.89</td><td>0.54</td><td>817</td><td>222</td><td><strong>2.64</strong></td><td><strong>4.522</strong></td><td>55</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td><strong>LH-01-20<sup>1</sup></strong></td><td>L-13</td><td>123</td><td>133.5</td><td><strong>10.5</strong></td><td>0.18</td><td>0.08</td><td>1236</td><td>329</td><td><strong>1.17</strong></td><td><strong>2.000</strong></td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>LH-01-20<sup>1</sup></strong></td><td>L-13</td><td>161</td><td>206</td><td><strong>45</strong></td><td>0.11</td><td>0.15</td><td>268</td><td>94</td><td><strong>0.61</strong></td><td><strong>1.053</strong></td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>540025</strong></td><td>M-12</td><td>41.04</td><td>62.50</td><td><strong>21.46</strong></td><td>0.68</td><td>0.84</td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td><td><strong>2.47</strong></td><td><strong>4.243</strong></td><td>No assay</td><td>No assay</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><sup>1</sup> Qualified in NI 43-101 report, 2002, &#8216;Lansdowne House Property, Bartman Lake Area, Northwestern Ontario&#8217; for Aurora Platinum Corp. by Richard J.
